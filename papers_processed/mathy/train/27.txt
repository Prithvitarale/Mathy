ABSTRACT
How should players bid in keyword auctions such as those
used by Google, Yahoo! and MSN? We consider greedy bid-
ding strategies for a repeated auction on a single keyword,
where in each round, each player chooses some optimal bid
for the next round, assuming that the other players merely
repeat their previous bid. We study the revenue, conver-
gence and robustness properties of such strategies. Most
interesting among these is a strategy we call the balanced
bidding strategy (bb): it is known that bb has a unique fixed
point with payments identical to those of the VCG mecha-
nism. We show that if all players use the bb strategy and
update each round, bb converges when the number of slots
is at most 2, but does not always converge for 3 or more
slots. On the other hand, we present a simple variant which
is guaranteed to converge to the same fixed point for any
number of slots. In a model in which only one randomly
chosen player updates each round according to the bb strat-
egy, we prove that convergence occurs with probability 1.
We complement our theoretical results with empirical stud-
ies.

Yahoo!. The basic setup is as follows: when a person per-
forms a query at a search engine, he receives a page of results
that contains the links the search engine has deemed rele-
vant to the search, together with sponsored links, i.e., paid
advertisements. From the advertiser’s perspective, this ap-
proach offers a great benefit: they can precisely target their
ads based on users’ search terms. For example, if a travel
agent “buys” the search term “Tahiti,” then when searching
on the word “Tahiti”, a user might be shown a link to the
web page for that travel agent offering, say, plane tickets to
Tahiti. If the user actually clicks on this link, he will be
transferred to the aforementioned web page. For each such
click, in which the advertiser receives a potential customer,
the advertiser pays the search engine.
The process of determining which ads get assigned to
which keywords (search terms) and how much each adver-
tiser pays is resolved via keyword auctions. Advertisers
choose which keywords they want to bid on and participate
in auctions for those keywords. For a keyword of interest,
each advertiser submits a bid stating the maximum amount
it is willing to pay for a click. When a user submits a query
on that keyword, an instantaneous auction is run to de-
termine which of the advertisers currently bidding on that
keyword are allocated advertising slots.
In the absence of budget constraints, there is one and
only one truthful auction that can in principle be used: the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves or VCG mechanism [12, 3, 7]. This
mechanism has the property that it is in the best interest of
the participating advertisers to bid their true valuation of a
click. Despite this appealing property of the VCG mecha-
nism, no search engine uses the VCG mechanism. Rather,
the most widely used auction is the non-truthful Generalized
Second Price or GSP auction (described in Section 2).
The fact that the GSP mechanism is not truthful means
that the participating advertisers are forced to undertake
the complicated task of choosing a bidding strategy. As-
demir [1] and Edelman et al.[4] observe that instability and
bidding wars can result from the use of the GSP mechanism.
To make matters worse, on a typical search page, there is
room for multiple sponsored links. The positioning of these
sponsored links affects the chances that a sponsored link will
be clicked on and thus these advertising slots have varying
desirability from the perspective of advertisers. This makes
the advertisers’ utilities a discontinuous function of their
bids. Overall, the resulting bidding is sufficiently complex
that many advertisers hire consultants or intermediaries to
do their bidding for them, often at significant cost.
In a typical day, an advertiser will choose one or more
search terms to target and compete in a potentially large
number of keyword auctions for those terms. At the same
time, advertisers have the opportunity to update their bids.
This is typically done automatically via software robots [9].
In this paper, we undertake a systematic exploration of a
natural class of greedy bidding strategies a software robot
might use in a repeated keyword auction for a particular
search term(s). The main theme is the following: If a par-
ticular advertiser A knew how the other bidders were going
to bid in the next round, A would bid so as to maximize
his utility. The greedy bidding strategies we study assume
that the recent past is the best prediction for the future: A
assumes that the other bidders will bid in the next round
exactly what they bid in the current round. Given this as-
sumption, A chooses his bid for the next round to maximize
his utility relative to this postulated set of bids by the other
bidders.
There is still substantial flexibility within this definition.
Suppose that, given the presumed bids by the other bidders,
the optimal advertising slot for A to target is slot s at price
ps, and that the price of the (higher click-through rate) slot
s−1 is ps−1. The GSP mechanism allows a range of bid val-
ues that will result in the same outcome from A’s perspective
(namely, any bid between ps and ps−1). We focus the bulk
of our study on one particular choice in this range: Balanced
Bidding (bb), in which the advertiser chooses his next bid
b so as to be indifferent between successfully winning the
targeted slot s at price ps, or winning a slightly more desir-
able slot at price b. bb is a particularly interesting strategy,
since a system in which all players bid according to bb has a
unique fixed point in which players are bidding according to
a Nash equilibrium of GSP and the payments to the search
engine are identical to those of the VCG mechanism. (See
Theorem 5.)
Our main results about bb are the following:
• For two slots, bb always converges to its unique fixed
point (Theorem 6 part 1).
• For three or more slots, bb need not ever converge, as-
suming that in each round, all players simultaneously
update their bids according to the bb greedy strategy
(Theorem 6 part 2).
• In an asynchronous model, where exactly one ran-
domly chosen player updates his bid each round ac-
cording to the bb strategy, bb bidding always con-
verges eventually (Theorem 6 part 4). This is not true
if the bidders are not chosen randomly.
• We present a simple variation on bb with the same
unique fixed point and prove that it converges to its
fixed point even in the synchronous model in which all
players update their bids according to bb at each step
(Theorem 10).
An important perspective on these results is the following:
The Nash equilibria of GSP are fairly straightforward to
characterize and have been understood for some time [5,
11, 10]. What was not known was if there was a natural
bidding strategy that would lead to these Nash equilibria.
Here we show how players can get to the most natural of
the GSP equilibria using a greedy strategy.
In Section 5, we explore a number of relevant issues. We
begin by experimentally studying the bb strategy, includ-
ing comparing the convergence of bb in synchronous and
asynchronous settings. We next compare the VCG revenue
to what would be obtained if the bidders used other natu-
ral greedy strategies: competitor busting (cb), in which the
advertiser chooses the highest bid value consistent with the
target slot, and altruistic bidding (ab), in which the adver-
tiser chooses the lowest bid value consistent with the target
slot. Finally, we explore the revenue obtained by the search
engines under GSP compared with VCG, assuming that bid-
ders eventually end up in some Nash equilibrium of GSP
(which of course is not necessarily the case). We comple-
ment these experiments with some theoretical bounds (The-
orem 16).
2. MODEL AND DEFINITIONS
Definition 1. A keyword auction is defined by:
• A set of k slots with click-through rates (CTRs) θ1 >
. . . > θk, where θi is the probability that the user will
click on the advertisement in slot i.
• A set of n players (advertisers) participating in the
auction, each one having a private valuation vi for a
click, v1 > . . . > vn.
• Based on knowledge of the mechanism and their own
private valuations, each player submits a bid to the
auction. We denote by bi the bid submitted by player
i.
• The mechanism:
– computes an allocation π of the slots to k different
players: πs is the identity of the player that is
allocated slot s.
– charges a price ps to the player πs for each click
on his advertisement.
• If player i is allocated slot s at price ps, player i’s
expected utility is θs(vi − ps).
The generalized second price auction is the most common
mechanism in use.
Definition 2. The generalized second price mechanism
(GSP) for keyword auctions uses the following allocation and
payment rules:
• Players are allocated slots in decreasing order of bids.1
• For each slot s, the payment ps of player πs is bπs+1 .
Players who do not win a slot make no payment and gain
no utility.
The GSP mechanism is not truthful, but has a continuum
of Nash equilibria that are well understood [5, 11, 10]. One
of these equilibria results in player payments identical to
those that would be made if the mechanism being employed
was VCG. We call this Nash equilibrium of GSP the VCG
1
Technically, there is also a “relevance” or per-advertiser
click-through rate ri associated with each advertiser i, and
bidders are actually ranked (assigned slots) in decreasing
order of ranking score, where the ranking score of bidder i
is biri. In this paper we assume ri = 1 for all i. All results
in the paper extend easily to the case where the ri values
are arbitrary.
equilibrium of GSP. GSP also has Nash equilibria in which
the revenue to the search engine is either higher or lower
than that in the VCG equilibrium (see, for example, Var-
ian [11] or Theorem 16 in this paper). It is not clear whether
any of these equilibria are actually reached in real keyword
auctions. It is also not clear what bidding strategy players
might employ to reach a particular equilibrium. One of the
goals of this paper is to gain some insight into these issues.
We consider a repeated keyword auction, with a fixed set
of n players and k slots. The participants in the repeated
auction have the opportunity to update their bids in be-
tween successive rounds. How should players bid? Natu-
rally, a player’s main objective is to maximize his own ex-
pected utility over multiple rounds of the auction. However,
without any real insight into the bidding strategies followed
by the rest of the players, it is difficult for one player to
make predictions about the future bids of other players and
hence choose an optimal bidding strategy. Thus, a natural
approach is to assume that the immediate past is the best
predictor of the future. This leads to a natural greedy-like
bidding scheme where a player assumes that all the other
bids will remain fixed in the next round. Under this as-
sumption, the rational choice for a player j is to bid so as
to win a slot s that maximizes his utility uj = θs(vj − ps).
This leads to the following definition.
Definition 3. Greedy Bidding Strategies
A greedy bidding strategy for a player j is to choose a bid
for the next round of a repeated keyword auction round so
as to maximize his utility uj, assuming the bids of all other
players b−j in the next round will remain fixed to their values
in the previous round.
Given b−j, denote by p−j(s) the payment player j would
make if he bids so as to win slot s. Let s∗
be the slot the
greedy bidder j will target. Then if player j is greedy, he will
bid b0
∈ (p−j(s∗
− 1), p−j(s∗
)). As b0
is not fully specified,
this defines a class of strategies that are distinguished by
the choice of b0
within the allowed range.
Advertisers participating in a keyword auction are often
business competitors. One of the most commonly observed
secondary objectives besides gaining the optimal slot is the
desire to “push” the prices paid by other advertisers higher.
This is naturally done by bidding in the high end of the
range mentioned earlier. However, there is the risk that a
change in other players’ bids could result in paying a higher
price than expected. Balancing these objectives leads to the
following bidding strategy.
Definition 4. Balanced Bidding
The Balanced greedy bidding strategy bb is the strategy
for a player j that, given b−j
• next targets the slot s∗
j which maximizes his utility
(greedy bidding choice), that is,
s∗
j = argmaxs{θs(vj − p−j(s))}.
• chooses its bid b0
for the next round so as to satisfy the
following equation:
θs∗
j
`
vj − p−j(s∗
j )
´
= θs∗
j −1
`
vj − b0´
.
If s∗
j is the top slot, we (arbitrarily) choose b0
= (vj +
p−j(1))/2. We can thus deal with all slots uniformly by
defining θ0 = 2θ1.
The intuition behind the bid selection is that the player
bids high enough to force the prices paid by his competitors
to rise, but not so high that if one of his competitors were
to just undercut him, he would mind getting a higher slot
at a price just below his own bid of b0
. The bb strategy is
an appealing strategy for the following reason.
Theorem 5. [5] If all the players are following the bb
strategy in an auction with all distinct θs, then the system
has a unique fixed point. In this fixed point, the revenue of
the auctioneer (and payments of each player) is equal to that
of the VCG equilibrium. The equilibrium bids b∗
j of the play-
ers in the fixed point of bb satisfy the following equations:
b∗
j =

vj if j ≥ k + 1 and
γjb∗
j+1 + (1 − γj)vj if 2 ≤ j ≤ k.
(1)
where γj = θj/θj−1.
3. CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES OF THE
BB STRATEGY
We study the convergence properties of the bb strategy
in a repeated keyword auction under two models. We refer
to our standard model, where all players simultaneously up-
date their bids on each round as the synchronous model. In
the asynchronous model, in each round, exactly one player
updates her bid, while the other players merely repeat their
previous bids. We consider both the case in which the player
performing the update is arbitrary and the case where the
player performing the update is chosen at random. This has
been studied, for example in Zhang [14]. The asynchronous
model is closer to actual practice in sponsored search, al-
though the synchronous model applies in on-line settings
where bids are updated in batches.
Theorem 6. Consider a repeated keyword auction where
all players are using the bb strategy starting with arbitrary
initial bids. We have:
1. A 2-slot auction system always converges to its fixed
point in both the synchronous and asynchronous mod-
els. The number of rounds until convergence in the
synchronous model is O(log((v2 − v3)/v3)), where the
constant depends on the click-through rates θ1 and θ2.
2. There exists a 3-slot auction system and set of initial
bids which does not converge in the synchronous model.
3. There exists a 3-slot auction system, a set of initial
bids, and an order in which the players update which
does not converge in the asynchronous model.
4. In the asynchronous model where players bid in ran-
dom order, no matter how many slots there are, the
system always converges to its fixed point.
Proof of Part 1:
Lemma 7. At every round t such that t > t1 = 2 +
logγ∗ ((1 − γ∗
)(v2 − v3)/v3), where γ∗
= max{θ1/θ0, θ2/θ1},
we have:
b1, b2 > v3,
b3 = v3.
Proof. Let b denote the third highest bid. By the second
round, b can never be more than v3. Suppose for some
round that b is less than v3. Take a player i in {1, 2, 3}.
In the next round, i will bid her value or target some slot
j ∈ {1, 2} and bid b0
i = (1−γj)vi +γjpj ≥ (1−γ∗
)v3 +γ∗
b =
b + (1 − γ∗
)(v3 − b). In either case,
(v3 − b0
i) ≤ γ∗
(v3 − b).
Initially v3 − b ≤ v3.
It takes at at most r = logγ∗ ((1 − γ∗
)(v2 − v3)/v3) before
v3 − b < (1 − γ∗
)(v2 − v3). (Recall that γ∗
< 1 as the θi’s
are decreasing.) In round r + 1, bidders i ∈ {1, 2} will each
bid either vi > v3 or target a slot j ∈ {1, 2} and bid
b0
i = (1 − γj)vi + γjpj ≥ (1 − γ∗
)v2 + γ∗
b
= b + (1 − γ∗
)(v2 − b) > b + (1 − γ∗
)(v2 − v3)
> v3,
hence in either case their bids are both above v3. In round
r +2, player 3 will then bid v3 while players 1 and 2 keep on
bidding above v3; this concludes the proof of the lemma.
Once the conditions of Lemma 7 hold, the price of slot 2
is fixed at p2 = v3. Let T2 = b∗
2 = (1 − θ2/θ1)v2 + (θ2/θ1)p2
and T1 = (1−θ2/θ1)v1 +(θ2/θ1)p2. If the last bids of players
1 and 2 were b1 and b2 then, in the next round, their bids
are:
b0
1 =

T1 if b2 > T1,
(v1 + b2)/2 otherwise.
(2)
b0
2 =

T2 if b1 > T2,
(v2 + b1)/2 otherwise.
Let bmin = min(b1, b2) be the minimum of the two bids.
Lemma 8. After at most t2 rounds, we have bmin ≥ T2,
where
t2 ≤ t1 + 2
θ1 − θ2
θ2
.
Proof. Assume that at time t > t1, we have bmin < T2.
Then it is easy to check that at the next round we have
b0
min ≥ (v2 + bmin)/2. This implies
b0
min − bmin ≥
v2 − bmin
2
≥
v2 − T2
2
=
θ2
θ1
v2 − p2
2
= δ.
Since at time t1 we have bmin ≥ v3, we will reach b0
min ≥
T2 after an additional number of rounds bounded by (T2 −
v3)/δ.
Finally, since at round t2 we have bmin ≥ T2, at time t2 + 1
we will have b0
2 = T2 < T1, and therefore at time t2 + 2 we
will have b00
2 = T2 = b∗
2 and b00
1 = (v1 + T2)/2 = b∗
1; we have
reached equilibrium. This proves Part 1 of the Theorem in
the synchronous model.
The proof of convergence in the asynchronous model is
similar, but complicated by the random order of bidding.
Lemma 7 holds with a constant factor increase in t1 to allow
for all bidders to make a bid. Lemma 8 is easier to check as in
this case only the top two players alter their bids, therefore
after t2 bid alternations we reach the same outcome.
Proof of Part 2: Unfortunately, an auction system where
all the players follow the bb strategy is not guaranteed to
converge when there are more than 2 slots. We will show
this with the following counterexample. Let there be three
slots with θ1 = 1, θ2 = 2/3, θ3 = 1/3 and four players with
values 161, 160, 159 and 100. Let the initial bids of 130.5,
130, 129.5 and 100, respectively. Then the bidding evolves
as below; in particular it is not convergent.
Round
Bidder Value 1 2 3
161 130.5 145.5 130.5
160 130 145.25 130
159 129.5 144.75 129.5
100 100 100 100
There is one inactive bidder, with the lowest value, who
will never be able to bid for a slot as the prices are all above
his utility. It the first round, the remaining bidders all target
the lowest slot. The bid from the highest-valued player is
low enough so that for the next round, all three top bidders
target the first slot. With these high bids, the price for any
player for the top slot is too high when compared with the
price of the last slot. Thus for the third round all three top
players target the last slot, and the cycle continues.
In this example the click-through rates follow a simple ge-
ometric sequence, similar to those observed in practice [6].
Note that in this example the bids are well-behaved, in the
sense that the bids are in the same order as the players’ val-
ues. Hence such regularity is not sufficient for convergence.
Finally, even though we used our convention of θ0 = 2, a
similar example can be constructed where the players are
cycling while targeting intermediate slots. This concludes
the proof of part 2.
Proof of Part 3: Consider the following three slot example
with θ1 = 1, θ2 = 0.1 and θ3 = 0.09 and the top three
bidders alternating in sequence.
Round
Value 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
102 19.2 80.8 80.8 80.8 19.2 19.2 19.2
101 19.1 19.1 90.9 90.9 90.9 19.1 19.1
100 59.6 59.6 59.6 95.45 95.45 95.45 59.6
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
Proof of Part 4: A proof sketch is given the Appendix.
Notes
• The example above showing that for 3 slots, bb doesn’t
converge in the synchronous model is not anomalous.
In Section 5, we show experimentally that in a signifi-
cant fraction of instances, bb does not converge in the
synchronous model.
• The bound we give on the time to convergence of bb
in the random asynchronous model is extremely loose.
We have run simulations to study the speed of conver-
gence in this setting and have found experimentally
that convergence is actually quite fast, certainly no
more than a polynomial in n, the number of bidders.
4. CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES OF THE
RESTRICTED-BB STRATEGY
We will now examine a variant of the bb strategy, called
rbb, where the players can only aim for their current slot or
a slot of lower click-through rate than the one they currently
have. The rbb strategy is designed so that it has the same
unique fixed point as bb. However, by restricting the degree
to which a player can be greedy, we will be able to show
that even in the synchronous model, rbb always converges
to the VCG equilibrium.
Definition 9. The Restricted Balanced Bidding ( rbb)
bidding strategy is the strategy where given b−j from the pre-
vious round, player j
• targets the slot s∗
j which maximizes his utility among
the slots with no higher click-through rate than his
current slot sj, that is,
s∗
j = argmax{θs(vj − p−j(s)) : s ≥ sj}.
• chooses her bid b0
for the next round so as to satisfy the
following equation: θs∗
j
`
vj −p−j(s∗
j )
´
= θs∗
j −1
`
vj −b0
´
.
To make sure this is well-defined for the first slot, we define
θ0 = 2θ1.
Theorem 10.
1. The system defined by a repeated keyword auction in
which all the players are following the rbb strategy
has a unique fixed point at which players are bidding
according to the VCG equilibrium, i.e. the equilibrium
bids b∗
j are given by Equation (1).
2. In the synchronous model the rbb strategy always con-
verges to its fixed point. The number of steps until
convergence is 2k
times

where γ∗
= maxi θi/θi−1.
Proof. The proof of Part 1 of the Theorem is very simi-
lar to that of Theorem 5. (See Edelman et al.[5].) To prove
Part 2, we first bound the number of steps until the price of
slot k and the set of players who will be allocated slots have
converged. As before, we define γi = θi/θi−1.
Lemma 11. Player p prefers to target slot j rather than
slot j − 1 if and only if
(1 − γj)vp + γjpj < pj−1.
The proof of this Lemma is simple algebra and is omitted.
Lemma 12. At every round t such that t > t1 = 2 +
logγ∗ ((1−γ∗
)(vk −vk+1)/vk+1), where γ∗
= maxi>0 θi/θi−1,
we have:
bi > vk+1 ∀i ≤ k,
bi = vi ∀i ≥ k + 1.
Proof. Let b denote the (k +1)st highest bid. By defini-
tion, b can never be more than vk+1. Suppose for some round
that b is less than vk+1. Take any player i in {1, 2, . . . , k+1}.
In the next round, i will either bid her value or target
some slot j ∈ {1, . . . k} and bid b0
i = (1 − γj)vi + γjpj ≥
(1 − γ∗
)vk+1 + γ∗
b ≥ b + (1 − γ∗
)(vk+1 − b). In either case,
(vk+1 − b0
i) ≤ γ∗
(vk+1 − b).
Initially vk+1 − b ≤ vk+1. How many rounds does it take
before vk+1−b < (1−γ∗
)(vk−vk+1)? At most r ≤ logγ∗ ((1−
γ∗
)(vk − vk+1)/vk+1). In round r + 1, bidders i ∈ {1, . . . k}
will each bid either vi > vk+1 or bid at least
b0
i = (1 − γj)vi + γjpj ≥ (1 − γ∗
)vk + γ∗
b
≥ b + (1 − γ∗
)(vk − b) > b + (1 − γ∗
)(vk − vk+1)
> vk+1,
hence in either case their bids are above vk+1. In round
r +2, player k +1 will then bid vk+1 while players 1, 2, . . . , k
continue to bid above vk+1; the other players don’t get a slot,
so they bid their value, and this concludes the proof.
We now need to prove that the allocation of the k slots
players to these k players converges to a fixed point.
At any time, for any i ∈ [1, k], consider the players al-
located slots [i + 1, k]. They are called stable if their bids
and prices satisfy Equation (1), that is, the allocation is in
order of decreasing values, and if π(j) is the player currently
allocated slot j, then the last bids of those players satisfied:
bπ(j) = γjbπ(j+1) + (1 − γj)vπ(j),
for every j ∈ [i + 1, k].
If the players allocated all slots [1, k] form a stable set,
then we have reached the fixed point of the rbb strategy.
Assume that the current setting is not (yet) a fixed point
of the rbb strategy. Let A be the maximum stable set, with
associated i ≥ 2, and let B be the set of players in slots [1, i].
Let bmin denote the minimum bid from players of B.
We define a partial order over sets of players. We say
that A0
 A if either A ⊂ A0
and A 6= A0
, or if the player
of minimum value in the symmetric difference of A and A0
belongs to A0 2
. This will be our measure of progress.
In the next round, observe that, following the rbb strat-
egy, players in A still bid in the same way as before. Let
b0
min be the new minimum bid from players of B, and p be
the player of B whose bid is b0
min. There are three cases to
consider.
1. p bids below pi. Let j ∈ [i+1, k] be the slot which was
targeted by p. By definition, p prefers slot j to slot j −
1, and so, by Lemma 11, the bid of p is less than pj−1.
By definition, the bid is (1 − γj)vp + γjpj > pj, thus it
falls in the interval (pj−1, pj) and p will be allocated
slot j. Recall that π(j) ∈ A denotes the player who
was in slot j in the previous round. Since set A is
stable, by definition we have pj−1 = (1−γj)vπ(j)+γjpj.
Since this is greater than the bid of p, it follows that
vπ(j) > vp. Moreover, since p prefers slot j to slot
j+1, by Lemma 11 again, we must have (1−γj+1)vp +
γj+1pj+1 > pj = (1 − γj+1)vπ(j+1) + γj+1pj+1, and so
vp > vπ(j+1). Thus A0
= {p0
∈ A : vp0 < vp} ∪ {p} is a
stable set, and A0
 A.
2. p targeted slot i. Then p is allocated slot i, A0
=
A ∪ {p} is a stable set, and A0
 A.
3. p targeted some slot j ≤ i − 1. Then A is still a stable
set, and bmin = pi−1 has increased: b0
min = (1−γj)vp +
γjpj ≥ bmin + (1 − γ∗
)(vp − bmin).
2
This corresponds to a lexicographic ordering of the sets.
We will prove that Case 3 can only happen a bounded
number x of times, (where x depends on the θj’s and the
vj’s but not on the bids) before Case 1 or 2 must occur.
Thus, the maximum stable set must change at least once
every x rounds, and when that happens, it is replaced by a
set which is larger in the  ordering. This implies that the
system converges to a fixed point and that the number of
rounds until convergence is bounded by 2k
(x+1), hence the
Theorem.
First, a useful technical lemma.
Lemma 13. Let ε = (1/2)θk(1−γ∗
) minq6=q0 |vq −vq0 |/θ1.
If pi−1 > vp − ε and vp > pi, then player p prefers slot i to
any slot j < i.
Proof. From player p’s viewpoint, the utility of slot i
is θi(vp − pi), the utility of slot j < i is θj(vp − pj) <
θj(vp − pi−1), and the ratio is
θj(vp − pi−1)
θi(vp − pi)
≤ ε
θj
θi(vp − pi)
≤ ε
θ1
θk(vp − pi)
.
Now,
vp − pi = vp − ((1 − γi+1)vπ(i+1) + γi+1pi+1)
= (1 − γi+1)(vp − vπ(i+1)) + γi+1(vp − pi+1),
which is at least (1 − γ∗
) minq6=q0 |vq − vq0 |. Plugging this
into the previous expression proves the Lemma.
Now, let x = log1/γ∗ ((v1 − vk+1)/ε). Assume that Case 3
happens for x consecutive rounds. Let pmin be the player in
B whose value is minimum and vmin be its value. Let b
(t)
min be
the minimum bid of players in B after t rounds, 0 ≤ t ≤ x.
If p ∈ B is the player defining the minimum bid in round
t + 1, we have:
b

min ≥ (1 − γ∗
)vp + γ∗
b
(t)
min ≥ (1 − γ∗

After x rounds, we get b

hence b
(x)
min ≥ vmin − (γ∗
)x
(vi − vk+1). Plugging in the value
of x yields b
(x)
min ≥ vmin − ε. From Lemma 13, we know that
pmin prefers slot i to any slot j < i. In the next round pmin
targets slot i and has to be the minimum bidder from B,
therefore we are now in Case 2. Thus there are at most x
occurrences of Case 3 between any two occurrences of Case
1 or Case 2, and the Theorem is proved.
5. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION
In the previous section, we showed how simple greedy bid-
ding strategies can lead to the VCG equilibrium. Are the
theoretical convergence bounds tight? How desirable is this
outcome for bidders and for the search engine? In this sec-
tion, we study these questions empirically. We first study
the convergence and bidder utility of the balanced bidding
strategies, before turning to other greedy bidding strategies.
We finish by comparing search engine revenue in equilibrium
with the VCG revenue.
5.1 Experimental Setup
In all experiments, we define the keyword auction as fol-
lows: we use three slots and four players. Following the
study of Feng et al.[6], we choose the click-through rates as
a geometrically decreasing sequence by θi = δi−1
for some
value of δ between 0 and 1, and plot our results as a func-
tion of δ. We take the average of 150 instances where for
each instance, the values of the four players are each inde-
pendently chosen from a normal distribution with mean 500
and deviation 200.
To analyze a bidding strategy, for each of the 150 in-
stances, the simulated strategy is run from starting bids
of 1 for all players, except for ab (defined later), which is
run from starting bids equal to the minimum player value.
Some experiments, such as those comparing equilibrium rev-
enue with VCG revenue, are not affected by the choice of
asynchronous or synchronous settings. Others, such as bb
convergence, do depend on the setting, and in such cases we
will discuss the differences.
5.2 Balanced Bidding Strategies: BB and RBB
We first demonstrate the frequency of synchronous non-
convergence of bb shown in Theorem 6 part 2. Figure 1a
plots the probability that bb converges. (When δ > .95,
it takes much longer for the system to reach a fixed point
or a cycle, and our simulations did not always reach that
point, so we plot two curves representing lower and upper
bounds to the convergence probability.) This figure indi-
cates that the non-convergent example in Theorem 6 is not
pathological: The non-convergence of bb is a practically ob-
served phenomenon which occurs for a significant fraction of
instances.
While we have proved that the bb strategy always con-
verges in an asynchronous setting, our theoretical bounds
on the rate of convergence are quite weak. Figure 1b plots
the average number of bids per player until convergence, as
function of the number of players. The average number of
bids per player increases linearly in the number of players.
This suggests a O(n2
) overall rate of convergence.
Our analysis suggests that bidders should use rbb rather
than bb in the synchronous setting, since it gets to the same
fixed point and has the advantage of always converging.
But, bidders considering this recommendation might won-
der about its effect on their utility. To study this concern,
we take one special player p and fix his value at 500, while
the values of the other players continue to be drawn from a
normal distribution with mean 500 and standard deviation
200. We then plot, as a function of δ, the ratio of player p’s
utility under rbb relative to his utility under bb.
We see in Figure 2 that when δ < .6, player p’s utility
in rbb is only about 90% of the utility he would get in bb.
Interestingly, as δ approaches 1, this is reversed: when δ is
close to 1, rbb yields better utility than bb. We think this
results from frequent non-convergence of bb when δ is small.
It is claimed [6] that in practice the click-through rates are
fit well by a geometric sequence with δ about .7. In that
range rbb and bb yield about the same revenue.
Note that our result appears to be robust: we have ob-
served that changing the value of the player under focus from
500 to 400 or to 600 (so as to make him either a relatively
lower valued player or a relatively higher valued player) does
not change the graph significantly.
5.3 Other Greedy Bidding Strategies: CB and
AB
So far we have focused on bb and rbb, and have found that
these strategies will result in search engine revenue equal to
the VCG revenue. Thus we can use the VCG revenue as

a benchmark for comparing search engine revenue. In this
section we examine two other greedy bidding strategies and
study their impact on search engine revenue, compared to
VCG revenue. For the following we let εprice be a suitably
small bid increment, for example 1¢.
5.3.1 Competitor Busting
A popular bidding strategy used in practice is known as
competitor busting [13]. This strategy is also referred to as
anti-social or vindictive bidding [2, 15], and may be used by
as many as 40% of the bidders on Yahoo! [15]. The idea
is that a player bids as high as possible while retaining her
desired slot, in order to make competitors pay as much as
possible and exhaust their advertising resources.
Definition 14. The Competitor-Busting greedy bidding
strategy ( cb) is the strategy for a player j that, given b−j
• next targets the slot s∗
j which maximizes her utility
(greedy bidding choice), that is,
s∗
j = argmax{θs(vj − p−j(s)) : s ≥ sj}.
• chooses her next bid as b0
= min{vj, p−j(s∗
j−1)−εprice}.
Convergence issues for cb are much more serious than for
bb: in general, the cb strategy does not have a fixed point!
Indeed, a player p in slot i will only have non-negligible util-
ity if the player in slot i+1 cannot raise her bid any further,
because it is equal to her value. In this case, unless the situ-
ation is degenerate, p will prefer to move to a different slot,
which will in turn lead other players to want different slots.
Thus, the only fixed point for cb is when all players are
bidding their values and those bids happen to be a Nash
equilibrium for the GSP strategy. Bids equal to the values
form a Nash equilibrium if and only if θi(vi −vi+1) ≥ θj(vi −
vj+1) for each i and j > i; for a random instance, these
constraints are satisfied with significant probability when δ
is close to 0.
Indeed, Figure 4 confirms this finding. Like in Figure 1,
we plot two curves, which are lower and upper bounds on
the probability of convergence. (The space between the two
curves corresponds to instances that have neither converged
nor begun to cycle; as cycle detection is inaccurate in the
asynchronous setting the true answer is probably nearer the
lower curve). We see that cb frequently converges when δ
is small, and rarely converges when δ is large. Figure 4 was
plotted in the asynchronous setting; the results are essen-
tially identical in the synchronous setting, showing that cb
does not exhibit different cycling behavior depending on the
format (in contrast to bb).
Given that cb is a well-known strategy, the auctioneer
might wonder how much revenue he obtains if every player
followed the cb strategy. Figure 3 compares the revenue
obtained from running GSP with the players following cb
in an asynchronous setting, with the revenue which would
have been obtained from running our benchmark, VCG (the
graph has the VCG revenue normalized to 1). This is good
news for the auctioneer: If the players follow the cb strat-
egy, then the auctioneer’s revenue is higher than the VCG
revenue, by up to 20%. Accordingly, player utility goes
down. The results are very similar in the synchronous set-
ting, showing the revenue properties of cb are robust.
5.3.2 Altruistic Bidding
Since competitor busting primarily benefits the auction-

eer, the players might consider trying a completely different
approach: altruism. A natural complement to the competi-
tor busting strategy, where players try to hurt other bidders
as much as possible, the altruistic strategy has players bid-
ding as low as possible to win their desired slot.
Definition 15. The Altruistic greedy bidding strategy ( ab),
is the strategy for a player j that, given b−j
• next targets the slot s∗
j which maximizes her utility
(greedy bidding choice), that is,
s∗
j = argmax{θs(vj − p−j(s)) : s ≥ sj}.
• chooses her next bid as b0
= min{vj, p−j(s∗
j ) + εprice}.
If there is no slot giving positive utility, bid vj.
Convergence issues for ab are even more serious than for
cb: the ab strategy has no fixed points when the θi’s are
separated. The auctioneer might worry about how much
revenue he would obtain if every player followed the ab strat-
egy. As can be seen in Figure 5, this fear is only somewhat
justified: ab produces low revenue, but more than the min-
imum Nash equilibrium of GSP. Like with the cb revenue,
these results from the asynchronous setting are very similar
to those in the synchronous setting. It would be interesting
to see if there are any auctions in practice where players
bid in this way, or if a bidding strategy converging to the
minimum Nash revenue exists.
5.4 Revenue in GSP Equilibria
How much revenue does GSP bring to search engines,
compared to the revenue generated by the VCG mecha-
nism? In order to evaluate this we assume that bidders
eventually end up in some Nash equilibrium of GSP (which
of course is not necessarily the case). Figure 6 plots the
average, over instances, of the ratio between the revenue in
some Nash equilibrium of GSP and the VCG revenue. Since
GSP has many different Nash equilibria, we consider three
extreme points: the maximum revenue Nash equilibrium,
the minimum revenue Nash equilibrium, and the maximum
revenue Nash equilibrium when the bidders are debt-averse,
i.e. never bid above their value. Kitts et al.[8] show evidence
that bidders usually follow a debt-averse bidding strategy.
From these experiments, we conclude the following: the
equilibrium revenue of GSP is within ±40% of the VCG
revenue, unless δ is close to 1 and bidders are willing to
bid above their value. This should be contrasted with Part
1 of Theorem 16, where we exhibit an example of a GSP
equilibrium with revenue much smaller than the VCG rev-
enue: our simulations indicate that such an example is an
anomaly.
We also see the following interesting behavior: If bidders
are debt-averse, then in equilibrium GSP generates at most
15% more revenue than VCG. This indicates that the impact
of choosing GSP over VCG is not as significant when ratio-
nal behavior leads to debt-averse bidding. The influence of

5.5 Theoretical results
The following theorem compares the auctioneer revenue
obtainable by the GSP mechanism to the revenue which
could have been obtained by using the VCG mechanism in-
stead.
Theorem 16. 1. For every K > 0, there exists a key-
word auction and a Nash equilibrium of the GSP mech-
anism whose revenue is at most 1/K times the revenue
of the VCG mechanism, and moreover, every bidder i
bids bi ≤ vi.
2. For every K > 0, there exists a keyword auction and
a Nash equilibrium of the GSP mechanism whose rev-
enue is at least K times the revenue of the VCG mech-
anism.
3. If every bidder i bids bi ≤ vi (ie. is debt-averse), then
for every keyword auction and Nash equilibrium of the
GSP mechanism, the revenue is at most α∗
times the
VCG revenue, were α∗
= maxi θi/(θi − θi+1).
Proof. Part 1: Here is an example showing that the rev-
enue to the auctioneer from a GSP equilibrium may be arbi-
trarily smaller than that the revenue from the VCG equilib-
rium. The example is for a two-slot auction, where θ1 = 1
and θ2 = 1
2
. The GSP revenue is 2θ1 + (1/2)θ2 = 2.25
whereas the VCG revenue is (x+1/2)θ1+(1/2)θ2 = x+(3/4).

Part 2: Here is an example showing that the revenue to

These examples rely on player values that are arbitrar-

the following expression from Varian [11], which gives the
payments that achieve the maximum Nash revenue.

Compare this with the VCG payments:
θipi =
X

vj(θj − θj+1) (4)
Observe that if the values are close to each other, the max-
imum revenue from a Nash equilibrium is close to the VCG
revenue: if vi+1 ≥ αvi, then the payments from (3) are at
most a factor of 1/α from the payments of (4).
Notice that the second example, with Nash revenue larger
the VCG revenue, entails the second player bidding much
more than his value. This example therefore is not debt-
averse (as we defined that concept in Section 5.4). Under the
more realistic debt-averse assumption we obtain the third
part of this theorem.
Part 3: Let RM
be the maximum debt-averse Nash rev-
enue. Note that the payment of i, pM
i , is at most vi+1.
If pM
i > vi+1, as all players are bidding at most their val-
ues, there would not be enough winners to fill the top i
slots. Thus the maximum risk-free Nash equilibrium rev-
enue is RM

P
1≤i≤k θivi+1. On the other hand, the VCG
payment of i is θipVCG

APPENDIX
Proof Sketch of Theorem 6, Part 3.
At time t, we say that a player p is activated if p is the
player who updates his bid while the other bidders repeat
their previous bids.
Lemma 17. Let T be a certain function of n, k, (θi), (vj).
For every starting configuration, there exists a sequence of
player activations, of length at most T, such that the result-
ing configuration is a fixed point.
Proof. The idea will be to emulate the proof of Theo-
rem 10. First, one can show that the result of Lemma 12
holds in the asynchronous setting, so that after t1 rounds,
bi > vk+1 for i ≤ k, and bi = vi for i ≥ k + 1, where t1 is
approximately n times the t defined in Lemma 12. The rest
of the sequence is partitioned into phases, corresponding to
stable sets, defined as in the proof of Theorem 10. Let A
be the current stable set, [i + 1, k] be the slots occupied by
the player of A, and B be the set of players occupying slots
[1, i]. Let pmin be the player in B whose value is minimum,
vmin be its value, and pi−1 be the price of slot i − 1.
Consider the three cases enumerated in the proof of The-
orem 10. We repeatedly activate the player currently in slot
i until either Case 1 or Case 2 occurs, or pi−1 > vmin − ε,
where ε is defined as in Lemma 13. We then activate player
pmin. At this point, Case 1 or Case 2 must occur, a new
stable set is defined, and the phase ends. This completes
the definition of the sequence.
This argument bounds the length T of the constructed
sequence of player activations by t1 plus k times the bound
in Theorem 10, Part 2, which is independent of the starting
configuration and bids.
With this Lemma, it is easy to complete the proof of
Theorem 6: In a random sequence, at every step we have
probability at least 1/n to choose the next activation as in
Lemma 17, hence the sequence will occur after about nT
steps on average, and in any case, it will occur with proba-
bility 1 after a finite time. This proves convergence.
