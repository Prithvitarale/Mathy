Abstract
The doubling constant of a metric space (X, d) is the
smallest value Œª such that every ball in X can be covered by
Œª balls of half the radius. The doubling dimension of X is
then defined as dim(X) = log2 Œª. A metric (or sequence of
metrics) is called doubling precisely when its doubling di-
mension is bounded. This is a robust class of metric spaces
which contains many families of metrics that occur in ap-
plied settings.
We give tight bounds for embedding doubling metrics
into (low-dimensional) normed spaces. We consider both
general doubling metrics, as well as more restricted fami-
lies such as those arising from trees, from graphs excluding
a fixed minor, and from snowflaked metrics. Our techniques
include decomposition theorems for doubling metrics, and
an analysis of a fractal in the plane due to Laakso [20]. Fi-
nally, we discuss some applications and point out a central
open question regarding dimensionality reduction in L2.
1 Introduction
A basic goal in the study of finite metric spaces is to approx-
imate some class of metric spaces by another more simple
or tractable class. Apart from being beautiful objects of
study lying at the intersection of analysis, combinatorics,
and geometry, the ideas and techniques generated in this
field have led to a number of powerful algorithmic applica-
tions (see, e.g. [14, 24, 28]).
We consider embeddings of finite metric spaces into Lp
spaces. Given a metric (X, d), the goal is to find a map
f : X ‚Üí Lp such that ||f(x)‚àíf(y)||p is close to d(x, y) for
all x, y ‚àà X. The worst-case factor by which distances are
expanded or contracted is called the distortion of the map
f. In general, our goal is to find bounds on the achievable

distortion in terms of certain fundamental properties of the
metric (X, d).
The general case is well-understood. Bourgain [4]
showed that every n-point metric embeds into Lp with
O(log n) distortion for any fixed p; it is shown in [25] that
this bound is tight, for all p ‚â§ 2, for the shortest path met-
ric on constant-degree expander graphs. This was later ex-
tended in [26], showing a tight upper bound of O(log n
p ) for
any Lp space.
In light of this, a significant amount of effort has been
made to understand the distortion achievable for restricted
classes of metric spaces. So far, the restrictions consid-
ered have been mostly topological. For L1 embeddings,
this is due partly to the intimate connection with multi-
commodity flows and approximations for the sparsest cut,
see e.g. [25, 3, 12].It is not too difficult to see that ev-
ery tree metric embeds isometrically into L1. MatousÃåek
[27] showed that every tree embeds into Lp with distortion
O((log log n)min( 1
2 , 1
p )
) and that this bound is tight for all
p > 1. Rao [32] showed that every planar graph embeds
into L2 with distortion O(
‚àö
log n), and this in fact holds for
any family which excludes a fixed minor. A matching lower
bound, yielded by a family of series-parallel metrics was
given in [29] (see also [19, 21]). Gupta et al. [12] show that
K4-free (series-parallel) and K2,3-free (outerplanar) graphs
embed into L1 with constant distortion.
Here, we consider restrictions not on the topology of the
metric, but on its geometry. More specifically, we exam-
ine how the ‚Äúvolume growth‚Äù of a metric affects its embed-
dability into Lp spaces. The notion of growth that we use is
well-studied, and is very similar to a notion of Assouad [2],
see also [13]. Our definition is technically slightly different
from Assouad‚Äôs, but the flavor is left unaltered; in particu-
lar, the notion of bounded growth is equivalent under either
framework.
For a metric (X, d), let Œª be the smallest value such that
every ball in X can be covered by Œª balls of half the ra-
dius. We define the doubling dimension of X as dim(X) =
log2 Œª. It can be shown, for instance, that for every fixed
p, the doubling dimension of d-dimensional `p space is
roughly d, and clearly for a finite metric dim(X) ‚â§ log |X|.
A metric (or sequence of metrics) is called doubling pre-
cisely when its doubling dimension is bounded. We discuss
1
this notion more thoroughly in Section 1.3.
Not only are doubling metrics interesting objects in their
own right, but they are also of practical concern. Growth
restrictions are very natural and are thought to occur in
real-world phenomena such as peer-to-peer networks (see
e.g. [30]) and data analysis (e.g., when the input data re-
sides on a low-dimensional manifold, cf. [34]). In fact,
various algorithms can be tailored to run efficiently on cer-
tain classes of growth-restricted metrics, as demonstrated
in [8, 31, 16, 17]. The metrics considered there are either
equivalent to or a subclass of those metrics which are dou-
bling; see Section 1.3.
1.1 Results and techniques
We are concerned with the broad roles of ‚Äúvolume‚Äù and
‚Äústructure‚Äù in determining the embeddability of a met-
ric. For instance, in Section 2, we show that every dou-
bling tree metric admits a constant distortion embedding
into `
O(1)
p (i.e., constant dimensional `p space) for any
p ‚àà [1, ‚àû]. This exhibits a very natural class of met-
ric spaces which embed into `2 with O(1) distortion, but
not isometrically. As discussed before, some tree met-
rics require ‚Ñ¶(
‚àö
log log n) distortion to embed into `2 [5],
while we prove that some doubling metrics require distor-
tion ‚Ñ¶(
‚àö
log n) (see Section 5). Thus it is precisely the
synthesis of these two properties that yields an enormous
improvement in embeddability.
That these metrics can be embedded using only O(1)
dimensions is perhaps even more surprising (see the dis-
cussion in Section 2), and as we will soon see, proves a
special case of a conjecture of Assouad. Our embedding
makes use of a novel partitioning algorithm for doubling
trees. The partition is described conveniently by a coloring
of the edges. Our algorithm either finds a good coloring or
a submetric which is a counterexample to the doubling as-
sumption. To achieve an embedding into O(1) dimensions,
we must reuse colors. We do this by defining a notion of ad-
jacency between paths, and arguing that the resulting graph
(whose vertices are paths) has bounded chromatic number.
In Section 3, we construct low-diameter decompositions
for general metrics whose parameters depend smoothly on
the doubling dimension. Such decompositions are the main
tool in many embedding results, as well as a number of
other applications. To construct these decompositions, we
adapt a probabilistic technique of [7]. For applications of
the decomposition later in the paper, it is important that the
probability space that we sample from be very compactly
defined (e.g., of size O(1) for the case of doubling metrics).
For this purpose, we use some ideas from [18], in conjunc-
tion with LovaÃÅsz Local Lemma, in order to exploit certain
locality properties of our decomposition. Our use of the lo-
cal lemma here, and elsewhere in the paper, can be made
algorithmic using standard techniques.
In Section 4, we devise a number of embeddings, some
which rely heavily on the clustering of Section 3. First,
we give a Bourgain-style embedding which shows that ev-
ery general doubling metric (X, d) embeds into `p with dis-
tortion O((log n)min( 1
2 , 1
p )
) for any p ‚àà [1, ‚àû). Instead of
forming coordinates by taking the distance to arbitrary sub-
sets of X, we instead use only subsets of appropriately sized
nets in X (see Section 1.2 for the definition of a net). Using
this embedding, along with another application of the local
lemma, we show that every doubling metric can be embed-
ded with 1 +  distortion into `
O(log n)
‚àû . See Section 6 for an
application to distance labeling schemes.
Unfortunately, although fairly simple, the distortion of
this Bourgain-style embedding degrades badly (exponen-
tially) with dim(X). Based on the clustering of Section
3, and an embedding technique of Rao [32], we show that
every n-point metric (X, d) embeds into `p with distortion
at most
O

dim(X) ¬∑ (log n)min( 1
2 , 1
p )

.
This provides a smooth upper bound on the distortion of
general metrics in terms of their dimension. In the case
of Euclidean embeddings, for instance, it beats Bourgain‚Äôs
general upper bound as long as dim(X) = o(
‚àö
log n).
In [2], it is proved that if (X, d) is a doubling metric, then
for any 0 < Œ± < 1, (X, dŒ±
) embeds into `k
2 with distortion
D, where k and D depend only on the doubling dimension
of X. Here, (X, dŒ±
) is the metric with all distances raised
to the power Œ± (this is called a snowflaked version of X).
Unfortunately, the dependence of k and D on dim(X) is
exponential. In Section 4, using a slight twist on the above
embedding technique, we give an algorithmic version of
Assouad‚Äôs proof, and drastically improve the dependence
of k and D to near-linear Assouad also conjectured that the
above result holds even when Œ± = 1. Although Semmes
[33] disproved this conjecture, we have shown that it holds
whenever (X, d) is a doubling tree metric.
In Section 5, we exhibit a family of series-parallel dou-
bling metrics which requires ‚Ñ¶(
‚àö
log n) distortion to em-
bed into `2, which shows that the upper bound of Section 4
is tight. This family is based on the construction of a frac-
tal due to Laakso [20]. (It was brought to our attention that
a similar analysis was obtained independently in [21], but
without an explicit dependence on n. In addition, the proof
techniques are subtly different.)
Finally, in Section 6, we mention some algorithmic ap-
plications of our results, and point out a very intriguing open
question regarding the roles of volume and structure in di-
mensionality reduction in Euclidean spaces.
1.2 Preliminaries
Here are some definitions used in the paper; the books by
Deza and Laurent [9] and by Heinonen [13] give more de-
2
tails on metric spaces. Let (X, dX ) and (Y, dY ) be two met-
ric spaces,1
and consider an injective map f : X ‚Üí Y . We
define
contraction(f) = sup
a,b‚ààX
dX(a, b)
dY (f(a), f(b))
,
expansion(f) = sup
a,b‚ààX
dY (f(a), f(b))
dX(a, b)
.
The distortion of f is defined by dist(f) = expansion(f) ¬∑
contraction(f) = ||f||Lip ¬∑ ||f‚àí1
||Lip. The distortion with
which X embeds into Y is the infimum of dist(f) over all
injective maps f : X ‚Üí Y .
As usual, we define cp(X) as the least distortion with
which X embeds into some `p space. Let G = (V, E) be
a simple undirected graph with non-negative edge lengths.
The edge lengths on G induce a natural metric dG(u, v)
given by the length of a shortest path between u and v in
G.
If we have two maps f1 : X ‚Üí Y1 and f2 : X ‚Üí Y2, we
define their direct sum f1 ‚äïf2 as the map f : X ‚Üí Y1 √óY2
given by f(x) = (f1(x), f2(x)). This extends naturally to
a direct sum of more than two functions.
We define the aspect ratio of (X, d) to be the ratio of
the largest distance to the smallest in X. For x ‚àà X and
r ‚â• 0, we define the open ball of radius r about x to be
B(x, r) = {y ‚àà X : d(x, y) < r}.
Finally, we say that a subset Y of X is an -net if
it satisfies (1) For every x, y ‚àà Y, d(x, y) ‚â•  and (2)
X ‚äÜ
S
y‚ààY B(y, ). Such nets always exist for any  > 0.
For finite metrics, they can be constructed greedily. For ar-
bitrary metrics, proof of their existence is an easy applica-
tion of Zorn‚Äôs lemma.
1.3 Notions of dimension and volume
Here we consider some notions meant to capture the ‚Äúvol-
ume growth‚Äù of arbitrary metric spaces and discuss relations
between them.
Doubling dimension. An alternative definition for the dou-
bling constant considers diameter (of subsets) instead of ra-
dius (of balls); that is, the doubling constant of a metric
space (X, d) is as the smallest Œª such that every subset of
X of diameter 2r can be covered by at most Œª subsets of
diameter at most r. Again, the doubling dimension of X is
then defined as dim(X) = log2 Œª. The main advantage of
this definition is that for any submetric Y ‚äÜ X, we have
dim(Y ) ‚â§ dim(X). In what follows, we will find it easier
to work with balls rather than arbitrary sets. Thus we will
use the definition given earlier (i.e., every ball in X can be
covered by Œª balls of half the radius). It is easy to see that
moving between the two definitions affects the dimension
1We are concerned mostly with finite metrics, but most of our results
extend to arbitrary metric spaces via standard compactness arguments.
by only a factor of 2.
The seminal paper of Assouad [2] showed that this no-
tion attains several natural properties (see also [13, Ch. 10]).
For instance, it can be shown that dim(Rk
) = Œò(k) when
Rk
is endowed with the `p norm. It follows that the upper
bound O(k) applies to any subset of Rk
. For a finite met-
ric space, clearly dim(X) ‚â§ log |X|. The next proposition
will be key. Its proof follows by applying the definition sev-
eral times to obtain a cover with balls of sufficiently small
radius, and then arguing that each net point is covered by a
distinct ball.
Proposition 1.1. Let (X, d) be a metric with doubling con-
stant Œª. If all pairwise distances in Y ‚äÜ X are at least r
(e.g., Y is an r-net of X), then for any point x ‚àà X and
radius t ‚â• r we have |B(x, t) ‚à© Y | ‚â§ Œªdlog 2t
r e.
The counting measure. Karger and Ruhl [16] considered
a notion of dimension that relies on the counting measure
(in finite metric spaces): Let K be the smallest constant
such that |B(x, 2r)| ‚â§ K|B(x, r)| for all x ‚àà X, r ‚â• 0.
(Strictly speaking, the requirement in their definition was
enforced only when |B(x, r)| was at least some threshold
n0. We ignore this for simplicity, but most of our tech-
niques are local and allow for such restrictions.) Through-
out, we refer to K as the KR-constant of X and define the
KR-dimension of X as dimKR(X) = log2 K. The next
proposition shows that bounded KR-dimension is a more
stringent requirement than bounded doubling dimension. Its
proof is relatively simple and is omitted from this version.
However, bounded KR-dimension means that the counting
measure is doubling, and thus this proposition is no more
than an instantiation of a well-known basic result: If a met-
ric space (X, d) has a doubling measure then the metric is
doubling. (See e.g. [13] for a thorough treatment of dou-
bling measures.)
Proposition 1.2. For any finite metric (X, d), dim(X) ‚â§
4 ¬∑ dimKR(X).
The converse, however, is not true; there are metrics
with bounded Assouad dimension whose KR-dimension is
‚Ñ¶(log |X|). For example, take an integer grid in the Eu-
clidean plane, and consider only the origin and the points
in the annulus n/2 < ||x|| ‚â§ n. This reflects certain frail-
ties in the definition of KR-dimension: Even if dimKR(X)
is bounded, this does not necessarily hold for submetrics
of X. Furthermore, the annulus itself has a bounded KR-
dimension, but this property is not maintained when even
one point (the origin) is added.
Local density. Finally, there is another natural notion of
volume, which has been used widely in the study of the
bandwidth of graphs [10]. Given an unweighted connected
graph G = (V, E), the local density of G, denoted Œ≤(G),
3
is the smallest value Œ≤ such that |B(v, r)| ‚â§ Œ≤ r for all
v ‚àà V, r > 0. It is easy to see that since G is unweighted
and connected, |B(v, r)| ‚â• r, hence |B(v, 2r)| ‚â§ 2Œ≤r ‚â§
2Œ≤|B(v, r)|, which implies that dim(G) ‚â§ 4 dimKR(G) ‚â§
4(log Œ≤(G) + 1).
2 Trees
In this section we prove Assouad‚Äôs conjecture for trees,
showing that every doubling tree can be embedded with
constant distortion into constant dimensional `p space for
every p ‚àà [1, ‚àû], where both constants depend only on the
doubling constant of the tree. Not many families of metrics
are known to have such powerful embeddings, and it may
be surprising that two seemingly orthogonal constraints are
needed for such a result. However, as mentioned in the in-
troduction, a constant distortion Euclidean embedding can-
not be achieved if either of the constraints is dropped. Fur-
thermore, the tree requirement cannot be relaxed either
topologically (i.e., to graphs excluding a fixed minor) or
graph-theoretically (i.e., to bounded treewidth graphs), as
even series-parallel graphs might require ‚Ñ¶(
‚àö
log n) distor-
tion in any Euclidean embedding (see Section 5).
The fact that these results can be extended to constant
dimension is even more surprising, especially since recent
results of Brinkman and Charikar [6] (see also a short proof
of [23], which even generalizes to the metrics exhibited in
Section 5 [22]) show extremely strong lower bounds on the
dimension required to embed simple series-parallel graphs
into `1.
On a high level, our embeddings consist of two steps.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that the tree is
rooted at some vertex. The first step partitions the edges of
the tree into monotone paths (i.e., those lying on some root-
leaf path), a process conveniently described by a coloring
of the tree edges. In the second step we identify the vari-
ous colors with distinct unit-length vectors, and map each
vertex v to the sum of the vectors corresponding to the col-
ors of the edges along the path from the root to v. We first
exhibit a simple constant distortion (but high-dimensional)
embedding in Section 2.1; we then show how to reduce the
dimensionality in Section 2.2.
2.1 Constant distortion embeddings
Let T = (V, E) be a tree rooted at r with (positive) edge
lengths ` : E ‚Üí R+
; by scaling, we can assume that all
edge have at least unit length. Let d denote the metric in-
duced on T. An edge-coloring of T with colors from C is
simply a map œá : E ‚Üí C. Since we have a rooted tree,
the ancestor-descendant relationship is well-defined: Now
a monotone path in T is the simple path between a vertex
and one of its descendants. We call an edge-coloring proper
if each color-class forms a monotone path in T. Finally, œá

Figure 2.1. Edge-coloring the tree T
is an Œ±-good coloring of T if œá is proper, and for every ver-
tex v ‚àà V and every ancestor u of v, the path from u to
v in T contains a monochromatic portion of length at least
Œ± ¬∑ d(u, v). The following lemma is standard, and thus a
proof is omitted (see, for instance, [27]).
Lemma 2.1. Let T = (V, E) be a rooted tree with non-
negative edge lengths. If T has an Œ±-good coloring then
cp(T) ‚â§ 2
Œ± for all p ‚àà [1, ‚àû].
We now define a certain class of ‚Äúbad comb‚Äù metrics,
and then show that doubling metrics do not have submet-
rics which are arbitrarily bad combs. A k-comb is a metric
induced by an edge-weighted tree T having the following
properties: It has a distinguished vertex c called the center,
and k edge-disjoint simple paths p1, . . . , pk called hairs.
For a constant Œ≥, the comb is called Œ≥-bad if for some value
L ‚â• maxi d(c, pi), the length of every hair is in the interval
[L, Œ≥L). We omit the proof of the next lemma, as it follows
easily from Proposition 1.1.
Lemma 2.2. A 2Œ≥
-bad k-comb (X, d) has doubling con-
stant ŒªX > k1/(Œ≥+3)
.
It thus suffices to exhibit good colorings for tree metrics
which exclude bad combs.
Theorem 2.3. Let 0 < Œ± ‚â§ 1/60. Then every tree metric
has either an Œ±-good coloring or a submetric which is a
4-bad (1/40Œ±)-comb.
We prove here the unweighted case of Theorem 2.3; the
weighted case is more involved and thus deferred to the full
version. (Notice that subdividing edges might increase the
doubling constant; consider for instance an n-leaf star with
edge lengths 2i
for i = 1, . . . , n.)
Proof of unweighted case. Let Pz be the set of edges in the
path from the root to z in the tree T, and let Pxy be the
edges on the path between x and y. We proceed by showing
an algorithm that finds an Œ±-good coloring, unless the tree
metric has a 4-bad (1/40Œ±)-comb. The algorithm is given
in Figure 2.1.
Algorithm BOUNDED-DISTORTION clearly colors every
edge exactly once and thus defines an edge-coloring œá; we
4
claim œá is proper. Indeed, the algorithm maintains the in-
variant that the colored edges form a connected subtree of
T containing the root. It follows that the edges colored in
any single execution of step 4 form a monotone path. Since
we use a new color each time around, the claim follows.
Now assume that œá is not Œ±-good. Then there exist ver-
tices u, v with u an ancestor of v and D = d(u, v) = |Puv|
with the following property: if u = w0, w1, . . . , w` = v
are the color-transition vertices on Puv, i.e., the subpath
Pwj wj+1
is a maximal monochromatic segment for each j,
then d(wj, wj+1) < Œ±D for all j. For each wj, consider
the execution of Step 5 in which Pwj‚àí1 wj
falls in Py and is
colored, and let yj denote the vertex y at this point in time.
(See Figure 2.2.)

Figure 2.2. An Œ±-bad coloring.
Let m be such that D/4 < rm ‚â§ D/2. We now claim
that for any j, if d(v, wj) ‚â• D/2 then yj ‚àà Ym. Indeed,
Ym is an rm ‚â§ D/2 net, hence B(v, D/2) must contain a
net point y0
‚àà Ym. Furthermore, this net point must be a
descendant of wj in T. It follows that all the edges in the
path Py0 are colored by the time y0
is considered as a net
point. Since that path contains Pwj‚àí1wj
, we know that yj is
considered no later than y0
, and thus yj ‚àà Ym.
Finally, consider all the vertices wj with d(u, wj) ‚â§
D/10. We just proved that all the corresponding yj are
in Ym; since Ym is an rm-net, d(yj, yj+1) ‚â• rm >
D/4. This implies that either d(wj, yj) ‚â• D/10 or
d(wj+1, yj+1) ‚â• D/10, as otherwise we would contra-
dict the triangle inequality d(yj, yj+1) ‚â§ d(yj, wj) +
d(wj, wj+1) + d(wj+1, yj+1). We can now obtain the
comb: for each j, at least one of Pwj yj
and Pwj+1 yj+1
is
a hair of length at least D/10. (Since the edges are unit-
weighted, we can cut off the paths to a length of exactly
D/10). These hairs are edge-disjoint because they are col-
ored differently, and the total number of hairs is at least
1
2 (D/10
Œ±D ‚àí3) ‚â• 1
40Œ± . Letting u be the center of the comb, we
have d(u, wj) ‚â§ D/10 for each hair (wj, yj), so we indeed
obtained a 4-bad (1/40Œ±)-comb. (For unit-weight trees we
actually get a 1.01-bad comb.)
Theorem 2.4. Every doubling tree metric T has cp(T) =
O(1).
Proof. Let Œª = ŒªT be the doubling constant of the met-
ric T. Setting Œ≥ = 2 in Lemma 2.2, the tree T does not
contain a 4-bad Œª6
-comb. Let Œ± = 1/40Œª6
; since Œª ‚â• 2,
the parameter Œ± is bounded above by 1/60, and hence The-
orem 2.3 implies that T has an Œ±-good coloring. Finally,
applying Lemma 2.1 gives us an embedding with distortion
cp(T) ‚â§ 80Œª6
.
2.2 Bounding the dimension (frugal coloring)
The algorithm of Section 2.1 gave us a constant distortion
embedding into `p spaces; however, it used up to a linear
number of dimensions. In this section, we reduce this dras-
tically by embedding into a constant number of dimensions.
Theorem 2.5. Every doubling tree metric embeds into
`
O(1)
p with O(1) distortion for every p ‚àà [1, ‚àû].
The proof again proceeds by edge-coloring the tree T =
(V, E), this time with O(1) colors; of course, the coloring
can no longer be proper, and we will have to reanalyze the
embedding. We will still make use of the ideas given in
Lemmas 2.1 and 2.3. In particular, we edge-color the tree
using only colors from a set C of |C| = ŒªO(log Œª)
colors;
essentially, we apply algorithm Bounded-Distortion with
an unbounded number of temporary colors (not from C),
and at the end of each iteration we replace the temporary
colors by colors from C. We prove here the unweighted case
and defer the extension to weighted trees to the full version.
Proof of unweighted case. For a path p, let `(p) be the
length of p. A coloring œá : V ‚Üí C will be called Œ±-
reasonable if, for every pair u, v ‚àà V with x = lca(u, v),
there exists a color c ‚àà C such that the following holds: If
Pu is the set of paths between x and u which are colored c,
and Pv is the same for v, then
P
p‚ààPu
`(p) ‚àí
P
p‚ààPv
`(p) ‚â• Œ± ¬∑ d(u, v).
It is straightforward that applying the embedding of
Lemma 2.1 to an Œ±-reasonable coloring of T with k col-
ors yields an embedding of T into `k
p with distortion at
most Œ±. (In fact, the dimension can be reduced further to
O( 1
Œ±2 log k) by using vectors Œ≤i that are near-orthogonal;
the details are omitted from this version of the paper.) Thus
it suffices to show that T has an Œ±-reasonable coloring.
We now color the edges of T using algorithm
BOUNDED-D&D given in Figure 2.2. Let Œª be the dou-
bling constant of T, and set Œ± = 1/40Œª6
as in Theorem
2.4. Let C be a set of |C| = Œª3 log(68/Œ±)
= ŒªO(log Œª)
colors.
To complete the proof of Theorem 2.5 it suffices to show
that this algorithm produces an Œ±/2-reasonable coloring œá
of T using only colors from C. To this end, Lemma 2.7
5
below shows that the algorithm can be implemented with
these few colors, and Lemma 2.8 proves that the coloring
the algorithm produces is Œ±/4-reasonable.
We will make use of the following proposition.
Proposition 2.6. Along any root-leaf path, the edges that
are colored in iteration i have total length at most 2ri. In
particular, `(p) ‚â§ 2ri for every path p ‚àà Pi.
Proof of Proposition 2.6. We can assume i > 1; the claim
is trivial for i = 1 since 2r1 > diam(T). For a leaf v, let
Si,v be the subset of edges along Pv that are actually colored
in iteration i. Consider the edge (x, y) of Si,v farthest from
the root, with y ‚àà Yi \ Yi‚àí1. Since y 6‚àà Yi‚àí1, there exists
y0
‚àà Yi‚àí1 with d(y, y0
) ‚â§ ri‚àí1 = 2ri, and furthermore,
Si,v ‚äÜ Py \ Py0 . It follows that Si,v is contained in the
path between y and lca(y, y0
), and thus its length is at most
d(y, lca(y, y0
)) ‚â§ d(y, y0
) ‚â§ 2ri.
Lemma 2.7. Step 9 of algorithm Bounded-D&D can be
done greedily with |C| = Œª3 log(68/Œ±)
.
Proof of Lemma 2.7. The proof idea is very simple: For
each path p ‚àà Pi, it suffices to show that the number of
paths that are adjacent to p and were permanently colored
before p is less than |C|‚àí1, and hence we can color p greed-
ily. We will, in fact, show something slightly stronger: We
show that the number of paths p0
‚àà P‚àó
i with p ‚Üî p0
is at
most |C|‚àí1. Let z ‚àà p be its endpoint farther from the root.
Let p0
‚àà P‚àó
i be adjacent to p, and let y0
‚àà p0
‚à© Yi be the net
point that caused p0
to be colored (in some iteration no later
than i). We now split the paths p0
into two types.
Type 1: `(p0
) ‚â§ 17
Œ± ri. In this case, y0
is close to
z; quantitatively, d(z, y0
) ‚â§ `(p) + d(p, p0
) + `(p0
) ‚â§
2ri + 16
Œ± ri + 17
Œ± ri < 34
Œ± ri. Hence each such path p0
corre-
sponds to a distinct point y0
‚àà B(z, 34
Œ± ri). But y0
belongs
to the ri-net Yi, so Proposition 1.1 implies that the number
of such points y0
, and hence the number of paths p0
, is at
most Œªdlog 68/Œ±e
 |C|/2.
Type 2: `(p0
) > 17
Œ± ri. These paths p0
form hairs of
length at least 17
Œ± ri in a comb centered at z. (Since we are
in a unit-weighted tree, we can truncate these paths to get
the correct length.) The distance of each hair from the cen-
ter z is d(z, p0
) ‚â§ `(p) + d(p, p0
) ‚â§ 2ri + 16
Œ± ri ‚â§ 17
Œ± ri.
Lemma 2.2 implies that X cannot have a 1.01-bad Œª3
-
comb, and thus the number of such hairs (and thus the num-
ber of paths p0
) is less than Œª4
‚â§ |C|/4.
Hence the total number of paths p0
‚àà P‚àó
i that are adja-
cent to any single path p ‚àà Pi is less than 3
4 |C| ‚â§ |C| ‚àí 1,
and we can extend the coloring to p.
Lemma 2.8. Algorithm Bounded-D&D computes an Œ±/4-
reasonable coloring.
Proof of Lemma 2.8. Let u, v ‚àà V with x = lca(u, v),
and assume without loss of generality that t = d(x, u) ‚â•
1
2 d(u, v). Recall that Œ± = 1/40Œª6
‚â§ 1/60; hence Theorem
2.4 guarantees a monochromatic path p of length at least Œ±t
between x and u. We will show that the lengths of all the
paths between x and v with color œá(p) add up to at most
Œ±t/2, which immediately implies that œá is Œ±/4-reasonable,
as desired.
Consider any maximal monochromatic path p0
between
x and v with œá(p) = œá(p0
), and let i0
be the iteration in
which p0
is colored. We claim that i0
> i0 + 2 where i0 is
the maximum index such that 2ri0
‚â• Œ±t. (We may assume
that Œ±t ‚â• 1 and thus ri0
‚â§ Œ±t ‚â§ 2ri0
.) Assuming this
claim, let us prove the lemma. For every such value of i0
,
Proposition 2.6 implies that the corresponding paths p0
have
total length at most 2ri0 ; now summing over all values i0
>
i0 +2 shows that the total length of paths having color œá(p)
is at most
P
i0>i0+2 2ri0 ‚â§ 4ri0+3 = ri0
/2 < Œ±t/2.
It remains to prove the claim. Assume for contradiction
that i0
‚â§ i0 + 2. We now have two cases, depending on the
iteration i at which p was colored. The first case is when
i0
‚â§ i, and hence p0
‚àà P‚àó
i . Clearly, d(p, p0
) ‚â§ d(u, v) ‚â§ 2t,
and Proposition 2.6 implies that Œ±t ‚â§ 2ri; putting the two
together gives d(p, p0
) ‚â§ 4
Œ± ri. Hence p, p0
are adjacent at
iteration i and cannot have the same color, which contra-
dicts the assumption that œá(p) = œá(p0
). The second case
is where i < i0
‚â§ i0 + 2, in which case p ‚àà P‚àó
i0 . A simi-
lar argument applies; since d(p, p0
) ‚â§ 2t ‚â§ 4
Œ± ri0
‚â§ 16
Œ± ri0 ,
we have that p, p0
are adjacent at iteration i0
, giving us the
desired contradiction.
3 Clustering
In this section, we give decomposition theorems (for gen-
eral metrics) whose performance behaves smoothly in terms
of their doubling dimension, yielding greatly improved re-
sults when the dimension is bounded.
3.1 The padded decomposition
First, we describe a useful low-diameter decomposition for
metric spaces. Under other guises, such decompositions
are the main tool in many embeddings, and have numerous
other applications.
For a metric space (X, d) and a subset S ‚äÜ X, let
diam(S) denote the diameter of the submetric induced on
S. Let P be a collection of all the partitions of X. Given a
partition P ‚àà P and x ‚àà X, define
œÄP (x) = sup{t : ‚àÉC ‚àà P with B(x, t) ‚äÇ C}.
Definition 3.1. An (r, Œµ)-padded probabilistic decomposi-
tion of a metric (X, d) is a distribution ¬µ over P satisfying:
1. Bounded diameter: diam(C) ‚â§ r for every cluster C
in every partition P in the support of ¬µ.

Œ± ri.
9. recolor the (temporarily colored) paths in Pi with colors from C
such that œá(p1) 6= œá(p2) for all p1, p2 ‚àà P‚àó
i with p1 ‚Üî p2.
Figure 2.3. Frugal edge-coloring of the tree T
2. Padding: Pr¬µ[œÄP (x) ‚â• Œµr] ‚â• 1
2 for all x ‚àà X.
Such decompositions have been given earlier for general
metrics, where 1/Œµ = O(log |X|). We show that such de-
compositions exist where Œµ depends only on the doubling
dimension of X. The probabilistic technique we use is in-
spired by the analysis of [7].
Theorem 3.2. Let (X, d) be a finite metric space. Then
for every r > 0 there exists an (r, Œµ)-padded probabilistic
decomposition of X with 1/Œµ ‚â§ 64 dim(X).
Proof. For ease of notation, we construct a (4r, Œµ)-padded
decomposition. Let N be an r-net of X. Let œÉ be a ran-
dom permutation on N, and choose a radius R uniformly at
random from (r, 2r]. For each y ‚àà N, define a cluster
Cy =

x ‚àà X : x ‚àà B(y, R) and œÉ(y) < œÉ(z)
for all z ‚àà N with x ‚àà B(z, R) .
Clearly, diam(Cy) ‚â§ 4r. Finally, let P = {Cy}y‚ààN and
note it is a partition of X because N is an r-net and R ‚â• r.
Now fix a point x ‚àà X and some t ‚àà [0, r]. Let
W = B(x, 2r + t) ‚à© N, and note that m = |W| ‚â§ 8dim(T )
by Proposition 1.1. Arrange the points w1, . . . , wm ‚àà W in
order of increasing distance from x, and let Ik be the inter-
val [d(x, wk)‚àít, d(x, wk)+t]. Let us say that B(x, t) is cut
by a cluster Cwk
if Cwk
‚à© B(x, t) 6= ‚àÖ but B(x, t) * Cwk
.
Finally, write Ek for the event that wk is the minimal ele-
ment in W (according to œÉ) for which Cwk
‚à© B(x, t) 6= ‚àÖ
and Cwk
cuts B(x, t). Then,
Pr[B(x, t) is cut] ‚â§

‚â§

(1 + ln m),
and the latter quantity is at most 8t
r dim(X). Finally, note
that when B(x, t) is not cut, we have œÄP (x) ‚â• t. Setting
t = 4r
64 dimC (X) , we see that Pr[œÄP (x) ‚â• t] ‚â• 1
2 as desired.
3.2 Locality and dimension
Decompositions like that given by Theorem 3.2 have seen
numerous applications in recent years. Often, one wants
a small distribution, i.e. a multi-set of m partitions D =
[P1, . . . , Pm] such that the uniform distribution on D satis-
fies condition (2) of Definition 3.1.
Usually, this is accomplished by choosing m = Œò(log n)
independent partitions according to ¬µ; a Chernoff bound
then yields the desired result. Here, we show that m =
O(dim(X) log dim(X)) partitions suffice. The idea is to
use the LovaÃÅsz Local Lemma along with some ideas bor-
rowed from [18] to exploit the locality of the padded de-
composition.
Theorem 3.3. For a metric space (X, d), let 1/Œµ =
512 dim(X). Then for any r ‚â• 0, there exists a multi-set
D = [P1, . . . , Pm] of m = O(dim(X) log dim(X)) parti-
tions such that
1. For every C ‚àà
Sm
i=1 Pi, diam(C) ‚â§ r.
2. If ¬µ is the uniform distribution on D then for all x ‚àà X,
Pr

.
Proof of Theorem 3.3. Let r > 0 be fixed and let ¬µ be as
in Theorem 3.2 (note that ¬µ depends on r). Let P1, . . . , Pm
be partitions of X chosen according to ¬µ (for some m to
be chosen later). For x ‚àà X, let Yx be the number of Pi
for which œÄPi
(x) ‚â§ 2Œµr. The probability of the latter event
is at most 1
8 according to the analysis of Theorem 3.2, and
thus EYx ‚â§ m
8 . Finally, let Em
x be the event that Yx > m
2 =
4 EYx. A standard Chernoff bound (see e.g. [1]) shows that
Pr[Em
x ] ‚â§ (9/10)m
.
7
Claim 3.4. If N is an Œµr-net in X then Pr
hV
y‚ààN Em
y
i
> 0.
Notice that the above claim suffices to prove the Theo-
rem. Indeed, if œÄP (y) ‚â• 2Œµr for every y ‚àà N, then by the
triangle inequality, œÄP (x) ‚â• Œµr for every x ‚àà X.
In proving the claim, we will require the following sym-
metric form of the LovaÃÅsz Local Lemma (see, e.g., [1]).
Lemma 3.5 (LovaÃÅsz Local Lemma). Let A1, . . . , An be
events in an arbitrary probability space. Suppose that each
Ai is mutually independent of all but at most d other events
Aj, and suppose that Pr[Ai] ‚â§ p for all 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n. If
ep(d + 1) ‚â§ 1 then Pr[‚àßn
i=1Ai] > 0.
We now claim that Em
y is mutually independent of all
events Em
y0 for which d(y, y0
) > 4r. To see this, note that
every cluster formed under ¬µ (according to Theorem 3.2)
has diameter at most r, thus no such cluster can simultane-
ously cut B(y, r) and B(y0
, r); the claimed independence
follows.
It follows that we can upper bound the number of
events that are non-mutually independent of Em
y by d =
|B(y, 4r) ‚à© N| ‚â§ dim(X)O(dim(X))
(by Proposition 1.1).
Now if Pr[Em
y ] ‚â§ 1
e(d+1) , then the local lemma implies
Claim 3.4. But this is easily accomplished by choosing
some m = O(dim(X) log dim(X)).
4 Upper bounds for doubling metrics
4.1 Bourgain-style embeddings via nets
Here, we give a simple proof that doubling metrics em-
bed into Euclidean space with O(
‚àö
log n) distortion. This
is based on Bourgain‚Äôs proof for general metrics, with the
added twist that we take distances from subsets of nets,
rather than subsets of the entire metric. A full proof is de-
ferred to the full version.
Theorem 4.1. For any n-point doubling metric (X, d),
the distortion required to embed X into `2 is c2(X) =
O(
‚àö
log n).
Proof (sketch). The idea of the embedding is as follows.
For every scale 2k
, k ‚àà Z, we construct a map œïk : X ‚Üí `2
given by œïk(x) =
p
1/2|Yk| (d(x, A))A‚ààYk
, where Yk is
the set of all subsets of some 2k
-net in X. The final map
is basically the normalized direct sum of all such maps,
i.e. ‚äïk2‚àí 1
2 |Yk|
œïk, though standard considerations must be
made to achieve a distortion which depends only on n and
not the aspect ratio of X.
It turns out that the dependence of the distortion on
dim(X) in the above theorem is exponential, and its worst-
case performance is much worse than Bourgain‚Äôs O(log n)
bound. We will remedy this in the next section, using the
decomposition theorems of Section 3.
By adapting the analysis of the above proof we can prove
the following theorem. In order to reduce the dimension to
O(log n), we bound the distortion among points in certain
nets using the LovaÃÅsz Local Lemma, and deduce from that
a bound on the distortion among all points. The 1 +  dis-
tortion is achieved by suitably modifying various constants
in the proof.
Theorem 4.2. For any fixed  > 0, every doubling metric
(1 + )-embeds into `
O(log n)
‚àû .
4.2 Embeddings via clustering
In this section, we obtain embeddings that degrade grace-
fully with the doubling dimension; these are based on the
decomposition theorems of Section 3. The next theorem
uses an embedding technique due to Rao [32]. Our analysis
requires considerably more effort since we must keep tight
control on the dimension of our embedding (this improves
the dimension of the host space by a factor of ‚Ñ¶(log n), say,
for doubling metrics, and is essential for Section 4.2.1).
Theorem 4.3. For any metric (X, d) and any p ‚àà [1, ‚àû),
cp(X) = O

dim(X) ¬∑ (log n)min( 1
2 , 1
p )

.
Proof (outline). Let (X, d) be an arbitrary metric and fix a
value r ‚â• 0. We discuss the case p = 2; the proof for other
values of p is similar. We produce a map Œ¶r : X ‚Üí Rk
with
k = O(dim(X) log dim(X)) as follows. Let P1, . . . , Pm
be the multi-set of decompositions guaranteed by Theorem
3.3. Fix some i ‚àà {1, . . . , m}, and for every cluster C ‚àà Pi,
choose a value sgn(C) ‚àà {‚àí1, +1} uniformly at random.
Following Rao [32] (see also [28, Ch. 15]), define the map
œïi : X ‚Üí R by
œïi(x) =
X
C‚ààPi
sgn(C) ¬∑ d(x, X \ C).
Finally, set Œ¶r = 1
‚àö
m
œï1 ‚äï ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚äï œïm.
Let Œµ be as in Theorem 3.3, let Nr be an Œµr
64 -net, and set
Sr = {{x, y} ‚àà N2
r : d(x, y) > r}. For {x, y} ‚àà Sr,
let Ex,y be the event that ||Œ¶r(x) ‚àí Œ¶r(y)|| < 1
8 Œµr. The
following lemma is deferred to the full version.

For any i ‚àà Z, let Œ¶(i)
= Œ¶2i , and set Œ¶ = ‚äïi‚ààZŒ¶(i)
.
The proof that Œ¶ satisfies the statement of Theorem 4.3
appears in the full version.
8
4.2.1 Assouad‚Äôs Theorem
Recall that for 0 < Œ± ‚â§ 1, (X, dŒ±
) is the metric that arises
from a metric (X, d) by raising all distances to the power Œ±.
In his seminal paper [2], Assouad proved the following (per-
haps surprising) result: For any doubling metric, and every
fixed 0 < Œ± < 1, there exist constants k and D (depend-
ing only on the doubling constant of X) such that (X, dŒ±
)
embeds into `k
2 with distortion at most D.
Although Assouad‚Äôs proof is easily converted to an al-
gorithm, the parameters k and D grow exponentially with
dim(X). We present an algorithmic version based on the
formation of coordinates in Section 4.2 and a trick of As-
souad [2] to avoid interaction between scales. The values k
and D that we achieve are both nearly linear in dim(X).
Theorem 4.5. Let (X, d) be an arbitrary metric, and fix
a value 0 < Œ± < 1. Then there exist values k =
O(dim(X) log dim(X)) and D = O(dim(X)) such that
(X, dŒ±
) can be embedded into `k
2 with distortion at most D.
We now show the construction of the embedding. A
proof is deferred to the full version. Let m = m(Œ±), choose
{e1, . . . , em} to be an orthonormal basis of Rm
, and extend
it to an infinite periodic sequence {ei}i‚ààZ. Now simply de-
fine Œ¶ : X ‚Üí Rk

(x) ‚äó ei.
5 Lower bounds on distortion
In this section we show that the dependence on n in the
upper bounds of Theorems 4.1 and 4.3 is necessary. In fact,
the next theorem shows that for Euclidean embeddings (p =
2) of doubling metrics, the aforementioned upper bounds
are existentially tight. (It extends easily to a tight lower
bound for any fixed p ‚â• 2.)
Theorem 5.1. There exists a family of metrics (Gk, dk)
which are uniformly doubling and series-parallel, such that
c2(Gk) = ‚Ñ¶(
p
log |Gk|).
We now describe the metrics (Gk, dk); they are shortest
path metrics on weighted series-parallel graphs. G0 consists
of a single edge of weight 1. Gk+1 is obtained from Gk
by replacing every edge in (u, v) in Gk with the six-edge
configuration shown in Figure 5.4. The weight of each new
edge is 4‚àík
. It is easy to see that (Gk, dk) is a submetric of
(Gk+1, dk+1).
In [19, 20], it is shown that a similar family of metrics is
uniformly doubling (see [21] for a very simple proof). The
lower bound follows from an appropriate PoincareÃÅ inequal-
ity whose basis is the following geometric fact: For any six
points s, t, a, b, c, d ‚àà L2, we have
||s ‚àí t||2
+ ||b ‚àí d||2
‚â§ 4(||a ‚àí s||2
+ ||c ‚àí t||2
)
+ 2(||a ‚àí b||2
+ ||b ‚àí c||2
+ ||c ‚àí d||2
+ ||d ‚àí a||2
).
By summing appropriately weighted versions of this in-
equality over all six-point subsets corresponding to ‚Äúcopies‚Äù
of G1, it is possible to obtain a simple PoincareÃÅ inequality
which immediately yields the desired lower bound.

6 Discussion
Applications. We briefly mention several algorithmic ap-
plications of our results, deferring details to the final ver-
sion. Using the decomposition theorems in Section 3, we
can show that doubling metrics admit (k,
‚àö
log n)-volume
respecting embeddings for all k; doubling metrics can also
be embedded into distributions of doubling trees (HSTs of
bounded degree) with distortion O(log n), and they embed
into the line with constant average distortion. These results
can be used to improve approximation algorithms and on-
line algorithms for doubling metrics.
The approximation ratio of the minimum bandwidth (lin-
ear ordering) problem can be improved using our results to
O(log2
n) for doubling trees and O(log3
n) for general dou-
bling graphs, improving over the general case by
‚àö
log n
and
‚àö
log log n factors respectively. Furthermore, our tree
coloring in conjunction with a modification of [11] show
that the bandwidth of a graph with local density Œ≤ is at most
O(Œ≤1.5
log2
n).
Distance-labelings of graphs assign labels to vertices so
that the distance between two vertices can be computed (ap-
proximately) from their labels alone. For simplicity, assume
that all pairwise distances are integers and are bounded by
‚àÜ. Theorem 4.2 can then be used to give labels for dou-
bling metrics with O(log n log ‚àÜ) bits, allowing to approx-
imate the distances within a (1 + ) factor. This has an ex-
ponential dependence on dim(X), which can be improved
to O(dim(X) log ‚àÜ log n (4
 )dim(X)
) bits per label for any
0 <  < 1, using techniques from Section 3.
Finally, the techniques of Section 3 can be used to exhibit
9
an O(dim(T))-approximation for the 0-extension problem
where (T, d) is the metric on terminals.
Dimensionality reduction. In previous sections, we stud-
ied the distortion of general metrics in terms of their dou-
bling dimension. Here, let us consider an n-point set X ‚äÜ
`n
2 with dim(X) = O(1). The Johnson-Lindenstrauss flat-
tening lemma [15] tells us that there is a 1 +  embedding
of X into `
O(‚àí2
log n
2 ). We pose the following intriguing
question which was asked independently in [21].
Question 1. Can every doubling submetric of `2 be O(1)-
embedded into `
O(1)
2 ?
It can be shown that no linear projection can achieve
such a result (as in [15]), but there are a number reasons to
believe that its resolution might be positive; these are dis-
cussed in the full version.
