Abstract
Mixture models are a fundamental tool in applied statistics and machine learning for treating data
taken from multiple subpopulations. The current practice for estimating the parameters of such
models relies on local search heuristics (e.g., the EM algorithm) which are prone to failure, and ex-
isting consistent methods are unfavorable due to their high computational and sample complexity
which typically scale exponentially with the number of mixture components. This work develops an
efficient method of moments approach to parameter estimation for a broad class of high-dimensional
mixture models with many components, including multi-view mixtures of Gaussians (such as mix-
tures of axis-aligned Gaussians) and hidden Markov models. The new method leads to rigorous
unsupervised learning results for mixture models that were not achieved by previous works; and,
because of its simplicity, it offers a viable alternative to EM for practical deployment.
1. Introduction
Mixture models are a fundamental tool in applied statistics and machine learning for treating data
taken from multiple subpopulations (Titterington et al., 1985). In a mixture model, the data are
generated from a number of possible sources, and it is of interest to identify the nature of the indi-
vidual sources. As such, estimating the unknown parameters of the mixture model from sampled
data—especially the parameters of the underlying constituent distributions—is an important statis-
tical task. For most mixture models, including the widely used mixtures of Gaussians and hidden
Markov models (HMMs), the current practice relies on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algo-
rithm, a local search heuristic for maximum likelihood estimation. However, EM has a number
of well-documented drawbacks regularly faced by practitioners, including slow convergence and
suboptimal local optima (Redner and Walker, 1984).
An alternative to maximum likelihood and EM, especially in the context of mixture models,
is the method of moments approach. The method of moments dates back to the origins of mix-
ture models with Pearson’s solution for identifying the parameters of a mixture of two univariate
Gaussians (Pearson, 1894). In this approach, model parameters are chosen to specify a distribu-
tion whose p-th order moments, for several values of p, are equal to the corresponding empirical
moments observed in the data. Since Pearson’s work, the method of moments has been studied
and adapted for a variety of problems; their intuitive appeal is also complemented with a guarantee

of statistical consistency under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the method often runs into trouble
with large mixtures of high-dimensional distributions. This is because the equations determining
the parameters are typically based on moments of order equal to the number of model parameters,
and high-order moments are exceedingly difficult to estimate accurately due to their large variance.
This work develops a computationally efficient method of moments based on only low-order
moments that can be used to estimate the parameters of a broad class of high-dimensional mixture
models with many components. The resulting estimators can be implemented with standard numer-
ical linear algebra routines (singular value and eigenvalue decompositions), and the estimates have
low variance because they only involve low-order moments. The class of models covered by the
method includes certain multivariate Gaussian mixture models and HMMs, as well as mixture mod-
els with no explicit likelihood equations. The method exploits the availability of multiple indirect
“views” of a model’s underlying latent variable that determines the source distribution, although
the notion of a “view” is rather general. For instance, in an HMM, the past, present, and future
observations can be thought of as different noisy views of the present hidden state; in a mixture
of product distributions (such as axis-aligned Gaussians), the coordinates in the output space can
be partitioned (say, randomly) into multiple non-redundant “views”. The new method of moments
leads to unsupervised learning guarantees for mixture models under mild rank conditions that were
not achieved by previous works; in particular, the sample complexity of accurate parameter estima-
tion is shown to be polynomial in the number of mixture components and other relevant quantities.
Finally, due to its simplicity, the new method (or variants thereof) also offers a viable alternative to
EM and maximum likelihood for practical deployment.
1.1. Related work
Gaussian mixture models. The statistical literature on mixture models is vast (a more thorough
treatment can be found in the texts of Titterington et al. (1985) and Lindsay (1995)), and many
advances have been made in computer science and machine learning over the past decade or so, in
part due to their importance in modern applications. The use of mixture models for clustering data
comprises a large part of this work, beginning with the work of Dasgupta (1999) on learning mix-
tures of k well-separated d-dimensional Gaussians. This and subsequent work (Arora and Kannan,
2001; Dasgupta and Schulman, 2007; Vempala and Wang, 2002; Kannan et al., 2005; Achlioptas
and McSherry, 2005; Chaudhuri and Rao, 2008; Brubaker and Vempala, 2008; Chaudhuri et al.,
2009) have focused on efficient algorithms that provably recover the parameters of the constituent
Gaussians from data generated by such a mixture distribution, provided that the distance between
each pair of means is sufficiently large (roughly either dc or kc times the standard deviation of the
Gaussians, for some c > 0). Such separation conditions are natural to expect in many clustering
applications, and a number of spectral projection techniques have been shown to enhance the sep-
aration (Vempala and Wang, 2002; Kannan et al., 2005; Brubaker and Vempala, 2008; Chaudhuri
et al., 2009). More recently, techniques have been developed for learning mixtures of Gaussians
without any separation condition (Kalai et al., 2010; Belkin and Sinha, 2010; Moitra and Valiant,
2010), although the computational and sample complexities of these methods grow exponentially
with the number of mixture components k. This dependence has also been shown to be inevitable
without further assumptions (Moitra and Valiant, 2010).
Method of moments. The latter works of Belkin and Sinha (2010), Kalai et al. (2010), and Moitra
and Valiant (2010) (as well as the algorithms of Feldman et al. (2005, 2006) for a related but differ-
33.2
A METHOD OF MOMENTS FOR MIXTURE MODELS AND HMMS
ent learning objective) can be thought of as modern implementations of the method of moments, and
their exponential dependence on k is not surprising given the literature on other moment methods
for mixture models. In particular, a number of moment methods for both discrete and continuous
mixture models have been developed using techniques such as the Vandermonde decompositions
of Hankel matrices (Lindsay, 1989; Lindsay and Basak, 1993; Boley et al., 1997; Gravin et al.,
2012). In these methods, following the spirit of Pearson’s original solution, the model parame-
ters are derived from the roots of polynomials whose coefficients are based on moments up to the
Ω(k)-th order. The accurate estimation of such moments generally has computational and sample
complexity exponential in k.
Spectral approach to parameter estimation with low-order moments. The present work is based
on a notable exception to the above situation, namely Chang’s spectral decomposition technique for
discrete Markov models of evolution (Chang, 1996) (see also Mossel and Roch (2006) and Hsu
et al. (2009) for adaptations to other discrete mixture models such as discrete HMMs). This spectral
technique depends only on moments up to the third-order; consequently, the resulting algorithms
have computational and sample complexity that scales only polynomially in the number of mixture
components k. The success of the technique depends on a certain rank condition of the transition
matrices; but this condition is much milder than separation conditions of clustering works, and
it remains sufficient even when the dimension of the observation space is very large (Hsu et al.,
2009). In this work, we extend Chang’s spectral technique to develop a general method of moments
approach to parameter estimation, which is applicable to a large class of mixture models and HMMs
with both discrete and continuous component distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Like the
moment methods of Moitra and Valiant (2010) and Belkin and Sinha (2010), our algorithm does not
require a separation condition; but unlike those previous methods, the algorithm has computational
and sample complexity polynomial in k.
Some previous spectral approaches for related learning problems only use second-order mo-
ments, but these approaches can only estimate a subspace containing the parameter vectors and
not the parameters themselves (McSherry, 2001). Indeed, it is known that the parameters of even
very simple discrete mixture models are not generally identifiable from only second-order mo-
ments (Chang, 1996)1. We note that moments beyond the second-order (specifically, fourth-order
moments) have been exploited in the methods of Frieze et al. (1996) and Nguyen and Regev (2009)
for the problem of learning a parallelepiped from random samples, and that these methods are very
related to techniques used for independent component analysis (Hyvärinen and Oja, 2000). Adapt-
ing these techniques for other parameter estimation problems is an enticing possibility.
Multi-view learning. The spectral technique we employ depends on the availability of multiple
views, and such a multi-view assumption has been exploited in previous works on learning mixtures
of well-separated distributions (Chaudhuri and Rao, 2008; Chaudhuri et al., 2009). In these previous
works, a projection based on a canonical correlation analysis (Hotelling, 1935) between two views
is used to reinforce the separation between the mixture components, and to cancel out noise orthogo-
nal to the separation directions. The present work, which uses similar correlation-based projections,
shows that the availability of a third view of the data can remove the separation condition entirely.
The multi-view assumption substantially generalizes the case where the component distributions
are product distributions (such as axis-aligned Gaussians), which has been previously studied in the
1. See Appendix G for an example of Chang (1996) demonstrating the non-identifiability of parameters from only
second-order moments in a simple class of Markov models.

literature (Dasgupta, 1999; Vempala and Wang, 2002; Chaudhuri and Rao, 2008; Feldman et al.,
2005, 2006); the combination of this and a non-degeneracy assumption is what allows us to avoid
the sample complexity lower bound of Moitra and Valiant (2010) for Gaussian mixture models. The
multi-view assumption also naturally arises in many applications, such as in multimedia data with
(say) text, audio, and video components (Blaschko and Lampert, 2008; Chaudhuri et al., 2009); as
well as in linguistic data, where the different words in a sentence or paragraph are considered noisy
predictors of the underlying semantics (Gale et al., 1992). In the vein of this latter example, we
consider estimation in a simple bag-of-words document topic model as a warm-up to our general
method; even this simpler model illustrates the power of pair-wise and triple-wise (i.e., bigram and
trigram) statistics that were not exploited by previous works on multi-view learning.
1.2. Outline
Section 2 first develops the method of moments in the context of a simple discrete mixture model
motivated by document topic modeling; an explicit algorithm and convergence analysis are also
provided. The general setting is considered in Section 3, where the main algorithm and its accom-
panying correctness and efficiency guarantee are presented. Applications to learning multi-view
mixtures of Gaussians and HMMs are discussed in Section 4. Proofs and additional discussion are
provided in the appendices.

2. Warm-up: bag-of-words document topic modeling
We first describe our method of moments in the simpler context of bag-of-words models for docu-
ments. Proofs of lemmas and theorems in this section are given in Appendix A.
2.1. Setting
Suppose a document corpus can be partitioned by topic, with each document being assigned a single
topic. Further, suppose the words in a document are drawn independently from a multinomial
distribution corresponding to the document’s topic. Let k be the number of distinct topics in the
corpus, d be the number of distinct words in the vocabulary, and ` ≥ 3 be the number of words in
each document (so the documents may be quite short).
The generative process for a document is given as follows:
1. The document’s topic is drawn according to the multinomial distribution specified by the
probability vector ~
w = (w1, w2, . . . , wk) ∈ ∆k−1. This is modeled as a discrete random
33.4
A METHOD OF MOMENTS FOR MIXTURE MODELS AND HMMS
variable h such that
Pr[h = j] = wj, j ∈ [k].
2. Given the topic h, the document’s ` words are drawn independently according to the multi-
nomial distribution specified by the probability vector ~
µh ∈ ∆d−1. The random vectors
~
x1, ~
x2, . . . , ~
x` ∈ Rd represent the ` words by setting
~
xv = ~
ei ⇔ the v-th word in the document is i, i ∈ [d]
(the reason for this encoding of words will become clear in the next section). Therefore, for
each word v ∈ [`] in the document,
Pr[~
xv = ~
ei|h = j] = h~
ei, ~
µji = Mi,j, i ∈ [d], j ∈ [k],
where M ∈ Rd×k is the matrix of conditional probabilities M := [~
µ1|~
µ2| · · · |~
µk].
This probabilistic model has the conditional independence structure depicted in Figure 3(a) as a
directed graphical model.
We assume the following condition on ~
w and M.
Condition 1 (Non-degeneracy: document topic model) wj >0 for all j ∈[k], and M has rank k.
This condition requires that each topic has non-zero probability, and also prevents any topic’s word
distribution from being a mixture of the other topics’ word distributions.
2.2. Pair-wise and triple-wise probabilities
Define Pairs ∈ Rd×d to be the matrix of pair-wise probabilities whose (i, j)-th entry is
Pairsi,j := Pr[~
x1 = ~
ei, ~
x2 = ~
ej], i, j ∈ [d].
Also define Triples ∈ Rd×d×d to be the third-order tensor of triple-wise probabilities whose
(i, j, κ)-th entry is
Triplesi,j,κ := Pr[~
x1 = ~
ei, ~
x2 = ~
ej, ~
x3 = ~
eκ], i, j, κ ∈ [d].
The identification of words with coordinate vectors allows Pairs and Triples to be viewed as ex-
pectations of tensor products of the random vectors ~
x1, ~
x2, and ~
x3:
Pairs = E[~
x1 ⊗ ~
x2] and Triples = E[~
x1 ⊗ ~
x2 ⊗ ~
x3]. (1)
We may also view Triples as a linear operator Triples: Rd → Rd×d given by
Triples(~
η) := E[(~
x1 ⊗ ~
x2)h~
η, ~
x3i].
In other words, the (i, j)-th entry of Triples(~
η) for ~
η = (η1, η2, . . . , ηd) is

2.3. Observable operators and their spectral properties
The pair-wise and triple-wise probabilities can be related in a way that essentially reveals the con-
ditional probability matrix M. This is achieved through a matrix called an “observable operator”.
Similar observable operators were previously used to characterize multiplicity automata (Schützenberger,
1961; Jaeger, 2000) and, more recently, for learning discrete HMMs (via an operator parameteriza-
tion) (Hsu et al., 2009).
Lemma 2 Assume Condition 1. Let U ∈ Rd×k and V ∈ Rd×k be matrices such that both U>
M
and V >
M are invertible. Then U>
PairsV is invertible, and for all ~
η ∈ Rd, the “observable
operator” B(~
η) ∈ Rk×k, given by
B(~
η) := (U>
Triples(~
η)V )(U>
PairsV )−1
,
satisfies
B(~
η) = (U>
M) diag(M>
~
η)(U>
M)−1
.
The matrix B(~
η) is called “observable” because it is only a function of the observable variables’
joint probabilities (e.g., Pr[~
x1 = ~
ei, ~
x2 = ~
ej]). In the case ~
η = ~
ex for some x ∈ [d], the matrix
B(~
ex) is similar (in the linear algebraic sense) to the diagonal matrix diag(M>
~
ex); the collection
of matrices {diag(M>
~
ex) : x ∈ [d]} (together with ~
w) can be used to compute joint probabilities
under the model (see, e.g., Hsu et al. (2009)). Note that the columns of U>
M are eigenvectors of
B(~
ex), with the j-th column having an associated eigenvalue equal to Pr[~
xv = x|h = j]. If the
word x has distinct probabilities under every topic, then B(~
ex) has exactly k distinct eigenvalues,
each having geometric multiplicity one and corresponding to a column of U>
M.
2.4. Topic-word distribution estimator and convergence guarantee
The spectral properties of the observable operators B(~
η) implied by Lemma 2 suggest the estimation
procedure (Algorithm A) in Figure 1. The procedure is essentially a plug-in approach based on the
equations relating the various moments in Lemma 2. We focus on estimating M; the mixing weights
~
w can be handled as a secondary step (see Appendix B.5).
On the choice of ~
η. As discussed in the previous section, a suitable choice for ~
η can be based
on prior knowledge about the topic-word distributions, such as ~
η = ~
ex for some x ∈ [d] that has
different conditional probabilities under each topic. In the absence of such information, one may
select ~
η randomly from the subspace range(Û). Specifically, take ~
η := Û~
θ where ~
θ ∈ Rk is a
random unit vector distributed uniformly over Sk−1.
The following theorem establishes the convergence rate of Algorithm A.
Theorem 3 There exists a constant C > 0 such that the following holds. Pick any δ ∈ (0, 1).
Assume the document topic model from Section 2.1 satisfies Condition 1. Further, assume that in
Algorithm A, [

Triples are, respectively, the empirical averages of N independent copies
of ~
x1 ⊗ ~

Some illustrative empirical results using Algorithm A are presented in Appendix A.5. A few
remarks about the theorem are in order.
On boosting the confidence. Although the convergence depends polynomially on 1/δ, where δ is
the failure probability, it is possible to boost the confidence by repeating Step 3 of Algorithm A with
different random ~
η until the eigenvalues of B̂(~
η) are sufficiently separated (as judged by confidence
intervals).
On the scaling factors cj. With a larger sample complexity that depends on d, an error bound can
be established for kµ̂j − ~
µτ(j)k1 directly (without the unknown scaling factors cj), but we do not
pursue this as the cj are removed in Algorithm B anyway.
3. A method of moments for multi-view mixture models
We now consider a much broader class of mixture models and present a general method of moments
in this context. Proofs of lemmas and theorems in this section are given in Appendix B.
3.1. General setting
Consider the following multi-view mixture model; k denotes the number of mixture components,
and ` denotes the number of views. We assume ` ≥ 3 throughout. Let ~
w = (w1, w2, . . . , wk) ∈
∆k−1 be a vector of mixing weights, and let h be a (hidden) discrete random variable with Pr[h =
j] = wj for all j ∈ [k]. Let ~
x1, ~
x2, . . . , ~
x` ∈ Rd be ` random vectors that are conditionally
independent given h; the directed graphical model is depicted in Figure 3(a).
33.7
ANANDKUMAR HSU KAKADE
Define the conditional mean vectors as
~
µv,j := E[~
xv|h = j], v ∈ [`], j ∈ [k],
and let Mv ∈ Rd×k be the matrix whose j-th column is ~
µv,j. Note that we do not specify anything
else about the (conditional) distribution of ~
xv—it may be continuous, discrete, or even a hybrid
depending on h.
We assume the following conditions on ~
w and the Mv.
Condition 2 (Non-degeneracy: general setting) wj > 0 for all j ∈ [k], and Mv has rank k for
all v ∈ [`].
We remark that it is easy to generalize to the case where views have different dimensionality (e.g.,
~
xv ∈ Rdv for possibly different dimensions dv). For notational simplicity, we stick to the same
dimension for each view. Moreover, Condition 2 can be relaxed in some cases; we discuss one such
case in Section 4.1 in the context of Gaussian mixture models.
Because the conditional distribution of ~
xv is not specified beyond its conditional means, it is
not possible to develop a maximum likelihood approach to parameter estimation. Instead, as in the
document topic model, we develop a method of moments based on solving polynomial equations
arising from eigenvalue problems.
3.2. Observable moments and operators
We focus on the moments concerning {~
x1, ~
x2, ~
x3}, but the same properties hold for other triples of
the random vectors {~
xa, ~
xb, ~
xc} ⊆ {~
xv : v ∈ [`]} as well.
As in (1), we define the matrix P1,2 ∈ Rd×d of second-order moments, and the tensor P1,2,3 ∈
Rd×d×d of third-order moments, by
P1,2 := E[~
x1 ⊗ ~
x2] and P1,2,3 := E[~
x1 ⊗ ~
x2 ⊗ ~
x3].
Again, P1,2,3 is regarded as the linear operator P1,2,3 : ~
η 7→ E[(~
x1 ⊗ ~
x2)h~
η, ~
x3i].
Lemma 4 and Lemma 5 are straightforward generalizations of Lemma 1 and Lemma 2.
Lemma 4 P1,2 =M1 diag(~
w)M>
2 and P1,2,3(~
η)=M1 diag(M>
3 ~
η) diag(~
w)M>
2 for all ~
η ∈ Rd.
Lemma 5 Assume Condition 2. For v ∈ {1, 2, 3}, let Uv ∈ Rd×k be a matrix such that U>
v Mv is
invertible. Then U>
1 P1,2U2 is invertible, and for all ~
η ∈ Rd, the “observable operator” B1,2,3(~
η) ∈
Rk×k, given by B1,2,3(~
η) := (U>
1 P1,2,3(~
η)U2)(U>
1 P1,2U2)−1, satisfies
B1,2,3(~
η) = (U>
1 M1) diag(M>
3 ~
η)(U>
1 M1)−1
.
In particular, the k roots of the polynomial λ 7→ det(B1,2,3(~
η) − λI) are {h~
η, ~
µ3,ji : j ∈ [k]}.
Recall that Algorithm A relates the eigenvectors of B(~
η) to the matrix of conditional means M.
The eigenvectors are only defined up to a scaling of each vector, so without prior knowledge of the
correct scaling, they are not sufficient to recover the parameters M. Nevertheless, the eigenvalues
also carry information about the parameters, as shown in Lemma 5, and it is possible to reconstruct
the parameters from different the observation operators applied to different vectors ~
η. This idea is
captured in the following lemma.
33.8
A METHOD OF MOMENTS FOR MIXTURE MODELS AND HMMS
Lemma 6 Consider the setting and definitions from Lemma 5. Let Θ ∈ Rk×k be an invertible
matrix, and let ~
θ>

polynomials of the B1,2,3(U3

θi), ∀i ∈ [k]). This template is also found in other moment methods
based on decompositions of a Hankel matrix. A crucial distinction, however, is that the k-th degree
polynomials in Lemma 6 only involve low-order moments, whereas standard methods may involve
up to Ω(k)-th order moments which are difficult to estimate (Lindsay, 1989; Lindsay and Basak,
1993; Gravin et al., 2012).
3.3. Main result: general estimation procedure and sample complexity bound
The lemmas in the previous section suggest the estimation procedure (Algorithm B) presented in
Figure 2.

1. Compute empirical averages from N independent copies of ~
x1 ⊗ ~
x2 to form P̂1,2 ∈ Rd×d
.
Similarly do the same for ~
x1 ⊗ ~

, and for ~
x1 ⊗ ~
x2 ⊗ ~
x3 to form P̂1,2,3 ∈
Rd×d×d
.
2. Let Û1 ∈ Rd×k
and Û2 ∈ Rd×k
be, respectively, matrices of orthonormal left and right singular
vectors of P̂1,2 corresponding to its top k singular values. Let Û3 ∈ Rd×k
be the matrix of
orthonormal right singular vectors of P̂1,3 corresponding to its top k singular values.
3. Pick an invertible matrix Θ ∈ Rk×k
, with its i-th row denoted as ~
θ>
i ∈ Rk
. In the absence of any
prior information about M3, a suitable choice for Θ is a random rotation matrix.
Form the matrix B̂1,2,3(Û3

Compute R̂1 ∈ Rk×k
(with unit Euclidean norm columns) that diagonalizes B̂1,2,3(Û3

4. For each i ∈ {2, . . . , k}, obtain the diagonal entries λ̂i,1, λ̂i,2, . . . , λ̂i,k of R̂−1
1 B̂1,2,3(Û3
~
θi)R̂1,
and form the matrix L̂ ∈ Rk×k
whose (i, j)-th entry is λ̂i,j.
5. Return M̂3 := Û3Θ−1
L̂.
Figure 2: General method of moments estimator (Algorithm B).
As stated, the Algorithm B yields an estimator for M3, but the method can easily be applied to
estimate Mv for all other views v. One caveat is that the estimators may not yield the same ordering
of the columns, due to the unspecified order of the eigenvectors obtained in the third step of the
method, and therefore some care is needed to obtain a consistent ordering. We outline one solution
in Appendix B.4.
The sample complexity of Algorithm B depends on the specific concentration properties of
~
x1, ~
x2, ~
x3. We abstract away this dependence in the following condition.
33.9
ANANDKUMAR HSU KAKADE
Condition 3 There exist positive scalars N0, C1,2, C1,3, C1,2,3, and a function f(N, δ) (decreasing
in N and δ) such that for any N ≥ N0 and δ ∈ (0, 1),
1. Pr

≥ 1 − δ for {a, b} ∈ {{1, 2}, {1, 3}},

v) − P1,2,3(~
v)k2 ≤ C1,2,3 · k~

i
≥ 1 − δ.
Moreover (for technical convenience), P̂1,3 is independent of P̂1,2,3 (which may be achieved, say, by
splitting a sample of size 2N).
For the discrete models such as the document topic model of Section 2.1 and discrete HMMs (Mos-
sel and Roch, 2006; Hsu et al., 2009), Condition 3 holds with N0 = C1,2 = C1,3 = C1,2,3 = 1,
and f(N, δ) = (1 +
p
ln(1/δ))/
√
N. Using standard techniques (e.g., Chaudhuri et al. (2009);
Vershynin (2012)), the condition can also be shown to hold for mixtures of various continuous
distributions such as multivariate Gaussians.
Now we are ready to present the main theorem of this section.
Theorem 7 There exists a constant C > 0 such that the following holds. Assume the three-view
mixture model satisfies Condition 2 and Condition 3. Pick any  ∈ (0, 1) and δ ∈ (0, δ0). Further,
assume Θ ∈ Rk×k is an independent random rotation matrix distributed uniformly over the Stiefel

4. Applications
In addition to the document clustering model from Section 2, a number of natural latent variable
models fit into this multi-view framework. We describe two such cases in this section: Gaussian
mixture models and HMMs, both of which have been (at least partially) studied in the literature. In
both cases, the estimation technique of Algorithm B leads to new learnability results that were not
achieved by previous works.
4.1. Multi-view and axis-aligned Gaussian mixture models
The standard Gaussian mixture model is parameterized by a mixing weight wj, mean vector ~
µj ∈
RD, and covariance matrix Σj ∈ RD×D for each mixture component j ∈ [k]. The hidden dis-
crete random variable h selects a component j with probability Pr[h = j] = wj; the conditional
33.10
A METHOD OF MOMENTS FOR MIXTURE MODELS AND HMMS
distribution of the observed random vector ~
x given h is a multivariate Gaussian with mean ~
µh and
covariance Σh.
The multi-view assumption for Gaussian mixture models asserts that for each component j, the
covariance Σj has a block diagonal structure Σj = blkdiag(Σ1,j, Σ2,j, . . . , Σ`,j) (a special case
is an axis-aligned Gaussian). The various blocks correspond to the ` different views of the data
~
x1, ~
x2, . . . , ~
x` ∈ Rd (for d = D/`), which are conditionally independent given h. The mean vector
for each component j is similarly partitioned into the views as ~
µj = (~
µ1,j, ~
µ2,j, . . . , ~
µ`,j). In the
case of an axis-aligned Gaussian, each covariance matrix Σj is diagonal, and therefore the original
coordinates [D] can be partitioned into ` = O(D/k) views (each of dimension d = Ω(k)) in any
way (say, randomly).2
Condition 2 requires that the conditional mean matrix Mv = [~
µv,1|~
µv,2| · · · |~
µv,k] for each view
v have full column rank (see Appendix D.2 for a possible relaxation). This is similar to the non-
degeneracy and spreading conditions used in previous studies of multi-view clustering (Chaudhuri
and Rao, 2008; Chaudhuri et al., 2009). In these previous works, the multi-view and non-degeneracy
assumptions are shown to reduce the minimum separation required for various efficient algorithms
to learn the model parameters. In comparison, Algorithm B does not require a minimum separation
condition at all.
Condition 3 can be established for this class of mixture models (in fact, even when the com-
ponent distributions are simply subgaussian; see Appendix D.3 for details). Therefore, Algorithm
B can be used to recover the means of each component distribution (and the covariances can be
recovered as well; see Appendix D.4).
4.2. Hidden Markov models
A hidden Markov model is a latent variable model in which a hidden state sequence h1, h2, . . . , h`
forms a Markov chain h1 → h2 → · · · → h` over k possible states [k]; and given the state ht
at time t ∈ [k], the observation ~
xt at time t (a random vector taking values in Rd) is condition-
ally independent of all other observations and states. The directed graphical model is depicted in
Figure 3(b).
The vector ~
π ∈ ∆k−1 is the initial state distribution: Pr[h1 = i] = πi for all i ∈ [k]. For
simplicity, we only consider time-homogeneous HMMs, although it is possible to generalize to
the time-varying setting. The matrix T ∈ Rk×k is a stochastic matrix describing the hidden state
Markov chain: Pr[ht+1 = i|ht = j] = Ti,j for all i, j ∈ [k], t ∈ [` − 1]. Finally, the columns of
the matrix O = [~
o1|~
o2| · · · |~
ok] ∈ Rd×k are the conditional means of the observation ~
xt at time t
given the corresponding hidden state ht: E[~
xt|ht = i] = O~
ei = ~
oi for all i ∈ [k], t ∈ [`]. Note that
both discrete and continuous observations are readily handled in this framework. For instance, the
conditional distribution of ~
xt given ht = i (for i ∈ [k]) could be a high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussian with mean ~
oi ∈ Rd. Such models were not handled by previous methods (Mossel and
Roch, 2006; Hsu et al., 2009).
The restriction of the HMM to three time steps, say t ∈ {1, 2, 3}, is an instance of the three-view
mixture model.
Proposition 8 If the hidden variable h (from the three-view mixture model of Section 3.1) is iden-
tified with the second hidden state h2, then {~
x1, ~
x2, ~
x3} are conditionally independent given h,
2. For product distributions (e.g., axis-aligned Gaussians) satisfying a certain incoherence condition, Condition 2 can
be established using a random partitioning of the coordinates; see Appendix D.1 for details.

η) = (U>

η) and
the equation (U>
3 O)−1R = T (up to scaling of the columns).

A.5. Some illustrative empirical results
As a demonstration of feasibility, we applied a modified version of Algorithm A to a subset of arti-
cles from the “20 Newsgroups” dataset, specifically those in comp.graphics, rec.sport.baseball,
sci.crypt, and soc.religion.christian, where ~
x1, ~
x2, ~
x3 represent three words from
the beginning (first third), middle (middle third), and end (last third) of an article. We used k = 25
(although results were similar for k ∈ {10, 15, 20, 25, 30}) and d = 5441 (after removing a standard
set of 524 stop-words and applying Porter stemming). Instead of using a single ~
η and extracting all
eigenvectors of B̂(~
η), we extracted a single eigenvector ~
ξx from B̂(~
ex) for several words x ∈ [d]
(these x’s were chosen using an automatic heuristic based on their statistical leverage scores in
[
Pairs). Below, for each such (B̂(~
ex), ~
ξx), we report the top 15 words y ordered by ~

The first and fourth topics appear to be about computer graphics (comp.graphics), the fifth and
sixth about baseball (rec.sports.baseball), the third about encryption (sci.crypt), and
the second about Christianity (soc.religion.christian).
We also remark that Algorithm A can be implemented so that it makes just two passes over the
training data, and that simple hashing or random projection tricks can reduce the memory require-
ment to O(k2 + kd) (i.e., [
Pairs and \
Triples never need to be explicitly formed).

B.4. Ordering issues
Although Algorithm B only explicitly yields estimates for M3, it can easily be applied to estimate
Mv for all other views v. The main caveat is that the estimators may not yield the same ordering
of the columns, due to the unspecified order of the eigenvectors obtained in the third step of the
method, and therefore some care is needed to obtain a consistent ordering. However, this ordering
issue can be handled by exploiting consistency across the multiple views.
The first step is to perform the estimation of M3 using Algorithm B as is. Then, to estimate M2,
one may re-use the eigenvectors in R̂1 to diagonalize B̂1,3,2(~
η), as B1,2,3(~
η) and B1,3,2(~
η) share the
same eigenvectors. The same goes for estimating Mv for other all other views v except v = 1.
It remains to provide a way to estimate M1. Observe that M2 can be estimated in at least two
ways: via the operators B̂1,3,2(~
η), or via the operators B̂3,1,2(~
η). This is because the eigenvalues
of B3,1,2(~
η) and B1,3,2(~
η) are the identical. Because the eigenvalues are also sufficiently separated
from each other, the eigenvectors R̂3 of B̂3,1,2(~
η) can be put in the same order as the eigenvectors
R̂1 of B̂1,3,2 by (approximately) matching up their respective corresponding eigenvalues. Finally,
the appropriately re-ordered eigenvectors R̂3 can then be used to diagonalize B̂3,2,1(~
η) to estimate
M1.
33.19
ANANDKUMAR HSU KAKADE
B.5. Estimating the mixing weights
Given the estimate of M̂3, one can obtain an estimate of ~
w using
ŵ := M̂†
3 Ê[~
x3]
where A† denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of A (though other generalized inverses may
work as well), and Ê[~
x3] is the empirical average of ~
x3. This estimator is based on the following
observation:
E[~
x3] = E[E[~
x3|h]] = M3E[~
eh] = M3 ~
w
and therefore
M†
3 E[~
x3] = M†
3 M3 ~
w = ~
w
since M3 has full column rank.
B.6. Proof of Theorem 7
The proof is similar to that of Theorem 3, so we just describe the essential differences. As before,
most perturbation arguments are deferred to Appendix C.
First, let E1 be the event in which
kP̂1,2 − P1,2k2 ≤ C1,2 · f(N, δ),
kP̂1,3 − P1,3k2 ≤ C1,3 · f(N, δ)
and
kP̂1,2,3(Û3
~
θi) − P1,2,3(Û3
~
θi)k2 ≤ C1,2,3 · f(N, δ/k)
for all i ∈ [k]. Therefore by Condition 3 and a union bound, we have Pr[E1] ≥ 1 − 3δ. Second, let
E2 be the event in which
γ := min

Since each ~

Pr[E2|E1] ≥ 1 − 2δ. Therefore Pr[E1 ∩ E2] ≥ (1 − 3δ)(1 − 2δ) ≥ 1 − 5δ.
Let U3 ∈ Rd×k be the matrix of top k orthonormal left singular vectors of M3. By Lemma 10

The following lemma establishes the accuracy of approximating the fundamental subspaces (i.e.,
the row and column spaces) of a matrix X by computing the singular value decomposition of a
perturbation X̂ of X.
Lemma 10 Let X ∈ Rm×n be a matrix of rank k. Let U ∈ Rm×k and V ∈ Rn×k be matrices
with orthonormal columns such that range(U) and range(V ) are spanned by, respectively, the left
and right singular vectors of X corresponding to its k largest singular values. Similarly define
Û ∈ Rm×k and V̂ ∈ Rn×k relative to a matrix X̂ ∈ Rm×n. Define X := kX̂ − Xk2, ε0 := X

where the first inequality follows from the triangle inequality, the second follows from the sub-
multiplicative property of the spectral norm, and the last follows from Lemma 10 and the first
claim.
The following lemma establishes standard eigenvalue and eigenvector perturbation bounds.
Lemma 12 Let A ∈ Rk×k be a diagonalizable matrix with k distinct real eigenvalues λ1, λ2, . . . , λk ∈
R corresponding to the (right) eigenvectors ~
ξ1, ~
ξ2, . . . , ~
ξk ∈ Rk all normalized to have k~
ξik2 = 1.
Let R ∈ Rk×k be the matrix whose i-th column is ~
ξi. Let Â ∈ Rk×k be a matrix. Define
A := kÂ − Ak2, γA := mini6=j |λi − λj|, and ε3 := κ(R)·A
γA
. Assume ε3 < 1
2 . Then there
exists a permutation τ on [k] such that the following holds:
1. Â has k distinct real eigenvalues λ̂1, λ̂2, . . . , λ̂k ∈ R, and |λ̂τ(i) −λi| ≤ ε3 ·γA for all i ∈ [k];
2. Â has corresponding (right) eigenvectors ˆ
ξ1, ˆ
ξ2, . . . , ˆ
ξk ∈ Rk, normalized to have kˆ
ξik2 = 1,
which satisfy kˆ
ξτ(i) − ~
ξik2 ≤ 4(k − 1) · kR−1k2 · ε3 for all i ∈ [k];
3. the matrix R̂ ∈ Rk×k whose i-th column is ˆ
ξτ(i) satisfies kR̂−Rk2 ≤ kR̂−RkF ≤ 4k1/2(k−
1) · kR−1k2 · ε3.
Proof The Bauer-Fike theorem (Lemma 22) implies that for every eigenvalue λ̂i of Â, there exists
an eigenvalue λj of A such that |λ̂i −λj| ≤ kR−1(Â−A)Rk2 ≤ ε3 ·γA. Therefore, the assumption
on ε3 implies that there exists a permutation τ such that |λ̂τ(i) − λi| ≤ ε3 · γA < γA

Since Â is real, all non-real eigenvalues of Â must come in conjugate pairs; so the existence of a
non-real eigenvalue of Â would contradict (12). This proves the first claim.
For the second claim, assume for notational simplicity that the permutation τ is the identity
permutation. Let R̂ ∈ Rk×k be the matrix whose i-th column is ˆ
ξi. Define ~
ζ>
i ∈ Rk to be the
i-th row of R−1 (i.e., the i-th left eigenvector of A), and similarly define ζ̂>

by the Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities and the sub-multiplicative property of the spectral
norm. The bound |ci,j| ≤ 2kR−1k2 · ε3 then follows from the first claim.
The third claim follows from standard comparisons of matrix norms.
The next lemma gives perturbation bounds for estimating the eigenvalues of simultaneously
diagonalizable matrices A1, A2, . . . , Ak. The eigenvectors R̂ are taken from a perturbation of the
first matrix A1, and are then subsequently used to approximately diagonalize the perturbations of the
remaining matrices A2, . . . , Ak. In practice, one may use Jacobi-like procedures to approximately
solve the joint eigenvalue problem.
Lemma 13 Let A1, A2, . . . , Ak ∈ Rk×k be diagonalizable matrices that are diagonalized by the
same matrix invertible R ∈ Rk×k with unit length columns kR~
ejk2 = 1, such that each Ai has k
distinct real eigenvalues:
R−1
AiR = diag(λi,1, λi,2, . . . , λi,k).
Let Â1, Â2, . . . , Âk ∈ Rk×k be given. Define A := maxi kÂi − Aik2, γA := mini minj6=j0 |λi,j −

2 and
ε4 < 1. Then there exists a permutation τ on [k] such that the following holds.
1. The matrix Â1 has k distinct real eigenvalues λ̂1,1, λ̂1,2, . . . , λ̂1,k ∈ R, and |λ̂1,j − λ1,τ(j)| ≤
ε3 · γA for all j ∈ [k].

Proof We have R = V diag(kV ~

The next lemma shows that randomly projecting a collection of vectors to R does not collapse
any two too close together, nor does it send any of them too far away from zero.

Appendix D. Proofs and details from Section 4
In this section, we provide omitted proofs and details from Section 4.
D.1. Learning mixtures of product distributions
In this section, we show how to use Algorithm B with mixtures of product distributions in Rn that
satisfy an incoherence condition on the means ~
µ1, ~
µ2, . . . , ~
µk ∈ Rn of k component distributions.
Note that product distributions are just a special case of the more general class of multi-view distri-
butions, which are directly handled by Algorithm B.
The basic idea is to randomly partition the coordinates into ` ≥ 3 “views”, each of roughly the
same dimension. Under the assumption that the component distributions are product distributions,
the multi-view assumption is satisfied. What remains to be checked is that the non-degeneracy
condition (Condition 2) is satisfied. Theorem 16 (below) shows that it suffices that the original
matrix of component means have rank k and satisfy the following incoherence condition.
Condition 4 (Incoherence condition) Let δ ∈ (0, 1), ` ∈ [n], and M = [~
µ1|~
µ2| · · · |~
µk] ∈ Rn×k
be given; let M = USV >
be the thin singular value decomposition of M, where U ∈ Rn×k is a
matrix of orthonormal columns, S = diag(σ1(M), σ2(M), . . . , σk(M)) ∈ Rk×k, and V ∈ Rk×k
is orthogonal; and let
cM := max
j∈[n]


The following inequality holds:
cM ≤
9
32
·
bn/`c
k · ln `·k
δ
.
Note that cM is always in the interval [1, n/k]; it is smallest when the left singular vectors in U have
±1/
√
n entries (as in a Hadamard basis), and largest when the singular vectors are the coordinate
axes. Roughly speaking, the incoherence condition requires that the non-degeneracy of a matrix
M be witnessed by many vertical blocks of M. When the condition is satisfied, then with high
probability, a random partitioning of the coordinates into ` groups induces a block partitioning of
M into ` matrices M1, M2, . . . , M` (with roughly equal number of rows) such that the k-th largest
singular value of Mv is not much smaller than that of M (for each v ∈ [`]).
Chaudhuri and Rao (2008) show that under a similar condition (which they call a spreading con-
dition), a random partitioning of the coordinates into two “views” preserves the separation between
33.27
ANANDKUMAR HSU KAKADE
the means of k component distributions. They then follow this preprocessing with a projection
based on the correlations across the two views (similar to CCA). However, their overall algorithm
requires a minimum separation condition on the means of the component distributions. In contrast,
Algorithm B does not require a minimum separation condition at all in this setting.
Theorem 16 Assume Condition 4 holds. With probability at least 1−δ, a uniformly chosen random
partitioning of [n] into ` disjoint sets [n] = I1 ∪ I2 ∪ · · · ∪ I`, each of size at least

of M indexed by Iv and scaling by

σk(Mv) ≥ σk(M)/2.
Proof Follows from Lemma 17 (below) together with a union bound.

The claim follows.
Proposition 18 (Reduction to sampling with replacement) Consider any m × n matrix A. For
any t ∈ [m], let e
At be a random t × n submatrix of A formed by choosing a random subset of t
rows of A uniformly at random without replacement; and let b
At be a random t × n submatrix of A
formed by choosing a random subset of t rows of A uniformly at random with replacement. Fix any
t ∈ [m] and τ > 0. Then
Pr[σn( e
At) < τ] ≤ Pr[σn( b
At) < τ].
Proof This argument is similar to one given by Recht (2009). We first prove that Pr[σn( e
At) < τ]
is non-increasing in t. For any t0 ≤ t, consider the following coupling between e
At and e
At0 :
1. First, sample t row indices in [m] uniformly at random without replacement, and select those
rows in A to form e
At.
2. Then, given these t row indices, choose t − t0 of them uniformly at random without replace-
ment, and remove them to form e
At0 .
Since σn( e

D.2. Relaxation of Condition 2 using higher-order moments
Even if Condition 2 does not hold (e.g., if ~
µv,j ≡ ~
m ∈ Rd (say) for all v ∈ [`], j ∈ [k] so all of
the component distributions have the same mean), one may still apply Algorithm B to the model
(h, ~
y1, ~
y2, . . . , ~
y`) where ~
yv ∈ Rd+d(d+1)/2 is the random vector that include both first- and second-
order terms of ~
xv, i.e., ~
yv is the concatenation of xv and the upper triangular part of ~
xv ⊗ ~
xv. In this
case, Condition 2 is replaced by a requirement that the matrices
M0
v :=

E[~
yv|h = 1] E[~
yv|h = 2] · · · E[~
yv|h = k]

∈ R(d+d(d+1)/2)×k
of conditional means and covariances have full rank. This requirement can be met even if the means
~
µv,j of the mixture components are all the same. Extending this to higher-order terms is immediate.
D.3. Empirical moments for multi-view mixtures of subgaussian distributions
The required concentration behavior of the empirical moments used by Algorithm B can be easily
established for multi-view Gaussian mixture models using known techniques (Chaudhuri et al.,
2009). This is clear for the second-order statistics P̂a,b for {a, b} ∈ {{1, 2}, {1, 3}}, and remains
true for the third-order statistics P̂1,2,3 because ~
x3 is conditionally independent of ~
x1 and ~
x2 given
h. The magnitude of hÛ3
~
θi, ~
x3i can be bounded for all samples (with a union bound; recall that
we make the simplifying assumption that P̂1,3 is independent of P̂1,2,3, and therefore so are Û3 and
P̂1,2,3). Therefore, one effectively only needs spectral norm error bounds for second-order statistics,
as provided by existing techniques.
Indeed, it is possible to establish Condition 3 in the case where the conditional distribution of
~
xv given h (for each view v) is subgaussian. Specifically, we assume that there exists some α > 0
such that for each view v and each component j ∈ [k],

D.4. Recovering the component covariances
While Algorithm B recovers just the means of the mixture components, we remark that a slight
variation can be used to recover the covariances as well. Note that
E[~
xv ⊗ ~
xv|h] = (Mv~
eh) ⊗ (Mv~
eh) + Σv,h = ~
µv,h ⊗ ~
µv,h + Σv,h
for all v ∈ [`]. For a pair of vectors ~
φ ∈ Rd and ~
ψ ∈ Rd, define the matrix Q1,2,3(~
φ, ~
ψ) ∈ Rd×d of
fourth-order moments by Q1,2,3(~
φ, ~
ψ) := E[(~
x1 ⊗ ~
x2)h~
φ, ~
x3ih~
ψ, ~
x3i].
Proposition 19 Under the setting of Lemma 5, the matrix given by
F1,2,3(~
φ, ~
ψ) := (U>
1 Q1,2,3(~
φ, ~

hence is diagonalizable (in fact, by the same matrices as B1,2,3(~
η)).
Proof As in the proof of Lemma 4, it is easy to show that
Q1,2,3(~
φ, ~
ψ) = E[E[~
x1|h] ⊗ E[~
x2|h]h~

The claim then follows from the same arguments used in the proof of Lemma 5.
D.5. Proof of Proposition 8
The conditional independence properties follow from the HMM conditional independence assump-
tions. To check the parameters, observe first that
Pr[h1 = i|h2 = j] =
Pr[h2 = j|h1 = i] · Pr[h1 = i]

The rest of the parameters are similar to verify.

Appendix G. Insufficiency of second-order moments
Chang (1996) shows that a simple class of Markov models used in mathematical phylogenetics
cannot be identified from pair-wise probabilities alone. Below, we restate (a specialization of) this
result in terms of the document topic model from Section 2.1.
Proposition 27 (Chang, 1996) Consider the model from Section 2.1 on (h, x1, x2, . . . , x`) with
parameters M and ~
w. Let Q ∈ Rk×k be an invertible matrix such that the following hold:

is a diagonal matrix.
Then the marginal distribution over (x1, x2) is identical to that in the case where the model has
parameters M̃ := MQ−1 and w̃ := Q~
w.
