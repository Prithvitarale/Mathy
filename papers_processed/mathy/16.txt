     Mixture models are a fundamental tool in applied statistics and machine learning for treating data
     taken from multiple subpopulations. The current practice for estimating the parameters of such
     models relies on local search heuristics (e.g., the EM algorithm) which are prone to failure, and ex-
     isting consistent methods are unfavorable due to their high computational and sample complexity
     which typically scale exponentially with the number of mixture components. This work develops an
     efficient method of moments approach to parameter estimation for a broad class of high-dimensional
     mixture models with many components, including multi-view mixtures of Gaussians (such as mix-
     tures of axis-aligned Gaussians) and hidden Markov models. The new method leads to rigorous
     unsupervised learning results for mixture models that were not achieved by previous works; and,
     because of its simplicity, it offers a viable alternative to EM for practical deployment.
1. Introduction
Mixture models are a fundamental tool in applied statistics and machine learning for treating data
taken from multiple subpopulations (Titterington et al., 1985). In a mixture model, the data are
generated from a number of possible sources, and it is of interest to identify the nature of the indi-
vidual sources. As such, estimating the unknown parameters of the mixture model from sampled
data—especially the parameters of the underlying constituent distributions—is an important statis-
tical task. For most mixture models, including the widely used mixtures of Gaussians and hidden
Markov models (HMMs), the current practice relies on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algo-
rithm, a local search heuristic for maximum likelihood estimation. However, EM has a number
of well-documented drawbacks regularly faced by practitioners, including slow convergence and
suboptimal local optima (Redner and Walker, 1984).
     An alternative to maximum likelihood and EM, especially in the context of mixture models,
is the method of moments approach. The method of moments dates back to the origins of mix-
ture models with Pearson’s solution for identifying the parameters of a mixture of two univariate
Gaussians (Pearson, 1894). In this approach, model parameters are chosen to specify a distribu-
tion whose p-th order moments, for several values of p, are equal to the corresponding empirical
moments observed in the data. Since Pearson’s work, the method of moments has been studied
and adapted for a variety of problems; their intuitive appeal is also complemented with a guarantee

of statistical consistency under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the method often runs into trouble
with large mixtures of high-dimensional distributions. This is because the equations determining
the parameters are typically based on moments of order equal to the number of model parameters,
and high-order moments are exceedingly difficult to estimate accurately due to their large variance.
    This work develops a computationally efficient method of moments based on only low-order
moments that can be used to estimate the parameters of a broad class of high-dimensional mixture
models with many components. The resulting estimators can be implemented with standard numer-
ical linear algebra routines (singular value and eigenvalue decompositions), and the estimates have
low variance because they only involve low-order moments. The class of models covered by the
method includes certain multivariate Gaussian mixture models and HMMs, as well as mixture mod-
els with no explicit likelihood equations. The method exploits the availability of multiple indirect
“views” of a model’s underlying latent variable that determines the source distribution, although
the notion of a “view” is rather general. For instance, in an HMM, the past, present, and future
observations can be thought of as different noisy views of the present hidden state; in a mixture
of product distributions (such as axis-aligned Gaussians), the coordinates in the output space can
be partitioned (say, randomly) into multiple non-redundant “views”. The new method of moments
leads to unsupervised learning guarantees for mixture models under mild rank conditions that were
not achieved by previous works; in particular, the sample complexity of accurate parameter estima-
tion is shown to be polynomial in the number of mixture components and other relevant quantities.
Finally, due to its simplicity, the new method (or variants thereof) also offers a viable alternative to
EM and maximum likelihood for practical deployment.
1.1. Related work
Gaussian mixture models. The statistical literature on mixture models is vast (a more thorough
treatment can be found in the texts of Titterington et al. (1985) and Lindsay (1995)), and many
advances have been made in computer science and machine learning over the past decade or so, in
part due to their importance in modern applications. The use of mixture models for clustering data
comprises a large part of this work, beginning with the work of Dasgupta (1999) on learning mix-
tures of k well-separated d-dimensional Gaussians. This and subsequent work (Arora and Kannan,
2001; Dasgupta and Schulman, 2007; Vempala and Wang, 2002; Kannan et al., 2005; Achlioptas
and McSherry, 2005; Chaudhuri and Rao, 2008; Brubaker and Vempala, 2008; Chaudhuri et al.,
2009) have focused on efficient algorithms that provably recover the parameters of the constituent
Gaussians from data generated by such a mixture distribution, provided that the distance between
each pair of means is sufficiently large (roughly either dc or k c times the standard deviation of the
Gaussians, for some c > 0). Such separation conditions are natural to expect in many clustering
applications, and a number of spectral projection techniques have been shown to enhance the sep-
aration (Vempala and Wang, 2002; Kannan et al., 2005; Brubaker and Vempala, 2008; Chaudhuri
et al., 2009). More recently, techniques have been developed for learning mixtures of Gaussians
without any separation condition (Kalai et al., 2010; Belkin and Sinha, 2010; Moitra and Valiant,
2010), although the computational and sample complexities of these methods grow exponentially
with the number of mixture components k. This dependence has also been shown to be inevitable
without further assumptions (Moitra and Valiant, 2010).
Method of moments. The latter works of Belkin and Sinha (2010), Kalai et al. (2010), and Moitra
and Valiant (2010) (as well as the algorithms of Feldman et al. (2005, 2006) for a related but differ-

ent learning objective) can be thought of as modern implementations of the method of moments, and
their exponential dependence on k is not surprising given the literature on other moment methods
for mixture models. In particular, a number of moment methods for both discrete and continuous
mixture models have been developed using techniques such as the Vandermonde decompositions
of Hankel matrices (Lindsay, 1989; Lindsay and Basak, 1993; Boley et al., 1997; Gravin et al.,
2012). In these methods, following the spirit of Pearson’s original solution, the model parame-
ters are derived from the roots of polynomials whose coefficients are based on moments up to the
Ω(k)-th order. The accurate estimation of such moments generally has computational and sample
complexity exponential in k.
Spectral approach to parameter estimation with low-order moments. The present work is based
on a notable exception to the above situation, namely Chang’s spectral decomposition technique for
discrete Markov models of evolution (Chang, 1996) (see also Mossel and Roch (2006) and Hsu
et al. (2009) for adaptations to other discrete mixture models such as discrete HMMs). This spectral
technique depends only on moments up to the third-order; consequently, the resulting algorithms
have computational and sample complexity that scales only polynomially in the number of mixture
components k. The success of the technique depends on a certain rank condition of the transition
matrices; but this condition is much milder than separation conditions of clustering works, and
it remains sufficient even when the dimension of the observation space is very large (Hsu et al.,
2009). In this work, we extend Chang’s spectral technique to develop a general method of moments
approach to parameter estimation, which is applicable to a large class of mixture models and HMMs
with both discrete and continuous component distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Like the
moment methods of Moitra and Valiant (2010) and Belkin and Sinha (2010), our algorithm does not
require a separation condition; but unlike those previous methods, the algorithm has computational
and sample complexity polynomial in k.
      Some previous spectral approaches for related learning problems only use second-order mo-
ments, but these approaches can only estimate a subspace containing the parameter vectors and
not the parameters themselves (McSherry, 2001). Indeed, it is known that the parameters of even
very simple discrete mixture models are not generally identifiable from only second-order mo-
ments (Chang, 1996)1 . We note that moments beyond the second-order (specifically, fourth-order
moments) have been exploited in the methods of Frieze et al. (1996) and Nguyen and Regev (2009)
for the problem of learning a parallelepiped from random samples, and that these methods are very
related to techniques used for independent component analysis (Hyvärinen and Oja, 2000). Adapt-
ing these techniques for other parameter estimation problems is an enticing possibility.
Multi-view learning. The spectral technique we employ depends on the availability of multiple
views, and such a multi-view assumption has been exploited in previous works on learning mixtures
of well-separated distributions (Chaudhuri and Rao, 2008; Chaudhuri et al., 2009). In these previous
works, a projection based on a canonical correlation analysis (Hotelling, 1935) between two views
is used to reinforce the separation between the mixture components, and to cancel out noise orthogo-
nal to the separation directions. The present work, which uses similar correlation-based projections,
shows that the availability of a third view of the data can remove the separation condition entirely.
The multi-view assumption substantially generalizes the case where the component distributions
are product distributions (such as axis-aligned Gaussians), which has been previously studied in the
  1. See Appendix G for an example of Chang (1996) demonstrating the non-identifiability of parameters from only
     second-order moments in a simple class of Markov models.

literature (Dasgupta, 1999; Vempala and Wang, 2002; Chaudhuri and Rao, 2008; Feldman et al.,
2005, 2006); the combination of this and a non-degeneracy assumption is what allows us to avoid
the sample complexity lower bound of Moitra and Valiant (2010) for Gaussian mixture models. The
multi-view assumption also naturally arises in many applications, such as in multimedia data with
(say) text, audio, and video components (Blaschko and Lampert, 2008; Chaudhuri et al., 2009); as
well as in linguistic data, where the different words in a sentence or paragraph are considered noisy
predictors of the underlying semantics (Gale et al., 1992). In the vein of this latter example, we
consider estimation in a simple bag-of-words document topic model as a warm-up to our general
method; even this simpler model illustrates the power of pair-wise and triple-wise (i.e., bigram and
trigram) statistics that were not exploited by previous works on multi-view learning.

motivated by document topic modeling; an explicit algorithm and convergence analysis are also
provided. The general setting is considered in Section 3, where the main algorithm and its accom-

2. Warm-up: bag-of-words document topic modeling
We first describe our method of moments in the simpler context of bag-of-words models for docu-
ments. Proofs of lemmas and theorems in this section are given in Appendix A.
2.1. Setting
Suppose a document corpus can be partitioned by topic, with each document being assigned a single
topic. Further, suppose the words in a document are drawn independently from a multinomial
distribution corresponding to the document’s topic. Let k be the number of distinct topics in the
corpus, d be the number of distinct words in the vocabulary, and ` ≥ 3 be the number of words in
each document (so the documents may be quite short).
     The generative process for a document is given as follows:
    1. The document’s topic is drawn according to the multinomial distribution specified by the
       probability vector w    ~ = (w1 , w2 , . . . , wk ) ∈ ∆k−1 . This is modeled as a discrete random
                                                        33.4

                             A M ETHOD OF M OMENTS FOR M IXTURE M ODELS AND HMM S
         variable h such that
                                                     Pr[h = j] = wj ,        j ∈ [k].
    2. Given the topic h, the document’s ` words are drawn independently according to the multi-
         nomial distribution specified by the probability vector µ                ~ h ∈ ∆d−1 . The random vectors
        ~x1 , ~x2 , . . . , ~x` ∈ Rd represent the ` words by setting
                                   ~xv = ~ei ⇔ the v-th word in the document is i,               i ∈ [d]
         (the reason for this encoding of words will become clear in the next section). Therefore, for
         each word v ∈ [`] in the document,
                                                                  ~ j i = Mi,j ,
                                    Pr[~xv = ~ei |h = j] = h~ei , µ                   i ∈ [d], j ∈ [k],
         where M ∈ Rd×k is the matrix of conditional probabilities M := [~                          µ2 | · · · |~
                                                                                                µ1 |~           µk ].
This probabilistic model has the conditional independence structure depicted in Figure 3(a) as a
directed graphical model.
     We assume the following condition on w              ~ and M .
Condition 1 (Non-degeneracy: document topic model) wj >0 for all j ∈[k], and M has rank k.
This condition requires that each topic has non-zero probability, and also prevents any topic’s word
distribution from being a mixture of the other topics’ word distributions.
2.2. Pair-wise and triple-wise probabilities
Define Pairs ∈ Rd×d to be the matrix of pair-wise probabilities whose (i, j)-th entry is
                                      Pairsi,j := Pr[~x1 = ~ei , ~x2 = ~ej ],    i, j ∈ [d].
Also define Triples ∈ Rd×d×d to be the third-order tensor of triple-wise probabilities whose
(i, j, κ)-th entry is
                              Triplesi,j,κ := Pr[~x1 = ~ei , ~x2 = ~ej , ~x3 = ~eκ ],    i, j, κ ∈ [d].
The identification of words with coordinate vectors allows Pairs and Triples to be viewed as ex-
pectations of tensor products of the random vectors ~x1 , ~x2 , and ~x3 :
                                Pairs = E[~x1 ⊗ ~x2 ]     and    Triples = E[~x1 ⊗ ~x2 ⊗ ~x3 ].                             (1)
We may also view Triples as a linear operator Triples : Rd → Rd×d given by
                                            Triples(~η ) := E[(~x1 ⊗ ~x2 )h~η , ~x3 i].
In other words, the (i, j)-th entry of Triples(~η ) for ~η = (η1 , η2 , . . . , ηd ) is
                                                  Xd                        Xd
                               Triples(~η )i,j =      ηx Triplesi,j,x =         ηx Triples(~ex )i,j .
                                                  x=1                       x=1
     The following lemma shows that Pairs and Triples(~η ) can be viewed as certain matrix products
involving the model parameters M and w.               ~

                                                               33.5

2.3. Observable operators and their spectral properties
The pair-wise and triple-wise probabilities can be related in a way that essentially reveals the con-
ditional probability matrix M . This is achieved through a matrix called an “observable operator”.
Similar observable operators were previously used to characterize multiplicity automata (Schützenberger,
1961; Jaeger, 2000) and, more recently, for learning discrete HMMs (via an operator parameteriza-
tion) (Hsu et al., 2009).
Lemma 2 Assume Condition 1. Let U ∈ Rd×k and V ∈ Rd×k be matrices such that both U > M
and V > M are invertible. Then U > PairsV is invertible, and for all ~η ∈ Rd , the “observable
operator” B(~η ) ∈ Rk×k , given by
                               B(~η ) := (U > Triples(~η )V )(U > PairsV )−1 ,
satisfies
                                  B(~η ) = (U > M ) diag(M > ~η )(U > M )−1 .
     The matrix B(~η ) is called “observable” because it is only a function of the observable variables’
joint probabilities (e.g., Pr[~x1 = ~ei , ~x2 = ~ej ]). In the case ~η = ~ex for some x ∈ [d], the matrix
B(~ex ) is similar (in the linear algebraic sense) to the diagonal matrix diag(M >~ex ); the collection
of matrices {diag(M >~ex ) : x ∈ [d]} (together with w)        ~ can be used to compute joint probabilities
under the model (see, e.g., Hsu et al. (2009)). Note that the columns of U > M are eigenvectors of
B(~ex ), with the j-th column having an associated eigenvalue equal to Pr[~xv = x|h = j]. If the
word x has distinct probabilities under every topic, then B(~ex ) has exactly k distinct eigenvalues,
each having geometric multiplicity one and corresponding to a column of U > M .
2.4. Topic-word distribution estimator and convergence guarantee
The spectral properties of the observable operators B(~η ) implied by Lemma 2 suggest the estimation
procedure (Algorithm A) in Figure 1. The procedure is essentially a plug-in approach based on the
equations relating the various moments in Lemma 2. We focus on estimating M ; the mixing weights
~ can be handled as a secondary step (see Appendix B.5).
w
On the choice of ~η . As discussed in the previous section, a suitable choice for ~η can be based
on prior knowledge about the topic-word distributions, such as ~η = ~ex for some x ∈ [d] that has
different conditional probabilities under each topic. In the absence of such information, one may
select ~η randomly from the subspace range(Û ). Specifically, take ~η := Û θ~ where θ~ ∈ Rk is a
random unit vector distributed uniformly over S k−1 .
     The following theorem establishes the convergence rate of Algorithm A.
Theorem 3 There exists a constant C > 0 such that the following holds. Pick any δ ∈ (0, 1).
Assume the document topic model from Section 2.1 satisfies Condition 1. Further, assume that in
Algorithm A, Pairs          \ are, respectively, the empirical averages of N independent copies
                [ and Triples
of ~x1 ⊗ ~x2 and ~x1 ⊗ ~x2 ⊗ ~x3 ; and that ~η = Û θ~ where θ~ ∈ Rk is an independent random unit vector
distributed uniformly over S k−1 . If

remarks about the theorem are in order.
On boosting the confidence. Although the convergence depends polynomially on 1/δ, where δ is
the failure probability, it is possible to boost the confidence by repeating Step 3 of Algorithm A with
different random ~η until the eigenvalues of B̂(~η ) are sufficiently separated (as judged by confidence
intervals).
On the scaling factors cj . With a larger sample complexity that depends on d, an error bound can
be established for kµ̂j − µ      ~ τ (j) k1 directly (without the unknown scaling factors cj ), but we do not
pursue this as the cj are removed in Algorithm B anyway.
3. A method of moments for multi-view mixture models
We now consider a much broader class of mixture models and present a general method of moments
in this context. Proofs of lemmas and theorems in this section are given in Appendix B.
3.1. General setting
Consider the following multi-view mixture model; k denotes the number of mixture components,
and ` denotes the number of views. We assume ` ≥ 3 throughout. Let w                       ~ = (w1 , w2 , . . . , wk ) ∈
∆k−1 be a vector of mixing weights, and let h be a (hidden) discrete random variable with Pr[h =
j] = wj for all j ∈ [k]. Let ~x1 , ~x2 , . . . , ~x` ∈ Rd be ` random vectors that are conditionally
independent given h; the directed graphical model is depicted in Figure 3(a).
                                                                33.7

                                          A NANDKUMAR H SU K AKADE
      Define the conditional mean vectors as
                                   ~ v,j := E[~xv |h = j],
                                   µ                          v ∈ [`], j ∈ [k],
 and let Mv ∈ Rd×k be the matrix whose j-th column is µ          ~ v,j . Note that we do not specify anything
 else about the (conditional) distribution of ~xv —it may be continuous, discrete, or even a hybrid
 depending on h.
      We assume the following conditions on w       ~ and the Mv .
 Condition 2 (Non-degeneracy: general setting) wj > 0 for all j ∈ [k], and Mv has rank k for
 all v ∈ [`].
 We remark that it is easy to generalize to the case where views have different dimensionality (e.g.,
~xv ∈ Rdv for possibly different dimensions dv ). For notational simplicity, we stick to the same
 dimension for each view. Moreover, Condition 2 can be relaxed in some cases; we discuss one such
 case in Section 4.1 in the context of Gaussian mixture models.
      Because the conditional distribution of ~xv is not specified beyond its conditional means, it is
 not possible to develop a maximum likelihood approach to parameter estimation. Instead, as in the
 document topic model, we develop a method of moments based on solving polynomial equations
 arising from eigenvalue problems.
 3.2. Observable moments and operators
 We focus on the moments concerning {~x1 , ~x2 , ~x3 }, but the same properties hold for other triples of
 the random vectors {~xa , ~xb , ~xc } ⊆ {~xv : v ∈ [`]} as well.
      As in (1), we define the matrix P1,2 ∈ Rd×d of second-order moments, and the tensor P1,2,3 ∈
 Rd×d×d of third-order moments, by
                        P1,2 := E[~x1 ⊗ ~x2 ] and         P1,2,3 := E[~x1 ⊗ ~x2 ⊗ ~x3 ].
 Again, P1,2,3 is regarded as the linear operator P1,2,3 : ~η 7→ E[(~x1 ⊗ ~x2 )h~η , ~x3 i].
      Lemma 4 and Lemma 5 are straightforward generalizations of Lemma 1 and Lemma 2.
 Lemma 4 P1,2 =M1 diag(w)M      ~ 2> and P1,2,3 (~η )=M1 diag(M3> ~η ) diag(w)M     ~ 2> for all ~η ∈ Rd .
 Lemma 5 Assume Condition 2. For v ∈ {1, 2, 3}, let Uv ∈ Rd×k be a matrix such that Uv> Mv is
 invertible. Then U1> P1,2 U2 is invertible, and for all ~η ∈ Rd , the “observable operator” B1,2,3 (~η ) ∈
 Rk×k , given by B1,2,3 (~η ) := (U1> P1,2,3 (~η )U2 )(U1> P1,2 U2 )−1 , satisfies
                               B1,2,3 (~η ) = (U1> M1 ) diag(M3> ~η )(U1> M1 )−1 .
 In particular, the k roots of the polynomial λ 7→ det(B1,2,3 (~η ) − λI) are {h~η , µ   ~ 3,j i : j ∈ [k]}.
      Recall that Algorithm A relates the eigenvectors of B(~η ) to the matrix of conditional means M .
 The eigenvectors are only defined up to a scaling of each vector, so without prior knowledge of the
 correct scaling, they are not sufficient to recover the parameters M . Nevertheless, the eigenvalues
 also carry information about the parameters, as shown in Lemma 5, and it is possible to reconstruct
 the parameters from different the observation operators applied to different vectors ~η . This idea is
 captured in the following lemma.
                                                       33.8

                          A M ETHOD OF M OMENTS FOR M IXTURE M ODELS AND HMM S
 Lemma 6 Consider the setting and definitions from Lemma 5. Let Θ ∈ Rk×k be an invertible
 matrix, and let θ~i> ∈ Rk be its i-th row. Moreover, for all i ∈ [k], let λi,1 , λi,2 , . . . , λi,k denote the
 k eigenvalues of B1,2,3 (U3 θ~i ) in the order specified by the matrix of right eigenvectors U1> M1 . Let
 L ∈ Rk×k be the matrix whose (i, j)-th entry is λi,j . Then
                                                          ΘU3> M3 = L.
       Observe that the unknown parameters M3 are expressed as the solution to a linear system in
 the above equation, where the elements of the right-hand side L are the roots of k-th degree poly-
 nomials derived from the second- and third-order observable moments (namely, the characteristic
 polynomials of the B1,2,3 (U3 θ~i ), ∀i ∈ [k]). This template is also found in other moment methods
 based on decompositions of a Hankel matrix. A crucial distinction, however, is that the k-th degree
 polynomials in Lemma 6 only involve low-order moments, whereas standard methods may involve
 up to Ω(k)-th order moments which are difficult to estimate (Lindsay, 1989; Lindsay and Basak,
 1993; Gravin et al., 2012).
 3.3. Main result: general estimation procedure and sample complexity bound
 The lemmas in the previous section suggest the estimation procedure (Algorithm B) presented in
 Figure 2.
    Algorithm B
         1. Compute empirical averages from N independent copies of ~x1 ⊗ ~x2 to form P̂1,2 ∈ Rd×d .
              Similarly do the same for ~x1 ⊗ ~x3 to form P̂1,3 ∈ Rk×k , and for ~x1 ⊗ ~x2 ⊗ ~x3 to form P̂1,2,3 ∈
              Rd×d×d .
         2. Let Û1 ∈ Rd×k and Û2 ∈ Rd×k be, respectively, matrices of orthonormal left and right singular
              vectors of P̂1,2 corresponding to its top k singular values. Let Û3 ∈ Rd×k be the matrix of
              orthonormal right singular vectors of P̂1,3 corresponding to its top k singular values.
         3. Pick an invertible matrix Θ ∈ Rk×k , with its i-th row denoted as θ~i> ∈ Rk . In the absence of any
              prior information about M3 , a suitable choice for Θ is a random rotation matrix.
              Form the matrix B̂1,2,3 (Û3 θ~1 ) := (Û1> P̂1,2,3 (Û3 θ~1 )Û2 )(Û1> P̂1,2 Û2 )−1 .
              Compute R̂1 ∈ Rk×k (with unit Euclidean norm columns) that diagonalizes B̂1,2,3 (Û3 θ~1 ), i.e.,
              R̂−1 B̂1,2,3 (Û3 θ~1 )R̂1 = diag(λ̂1,1 , λ̂1,2 , . . . , λ̂1,k ). (Fail if not possible.)
                 1
         4. For each i ∈ {2, . . . , k}, obtain the diagonal entries λ̂i,1 , λ̂i,2 , . . . , λ̂i,k of R̂1−1 B̂1,2,3 (Û3 θ~i )R̂1 ,
              and form the matrix L̂ ∈ Rk×k whose (i, j)-th entry is λ̂i,j .
         5. Return M̂3 := Û3 Θ−1 L̂.
                         Figure 2: General method of moments estimator (Algorithm B).
       As stated, the Algorithm B yields an estimator for M3 , but the method can easily be applied to
 estimate Mv for all other views v. One caveat is that the estimators may not yield the same ordering
 of the columns, due to the unspecified order of the eigenvectors obtained in the third step of the
 method, and therefore some care is needed to obtain a consistent ordering. We outline one solution
 in Appendix B.4.
       The sample complexity of Algorithm B depends on the specific concentration properties of
~x1 , ~x2 , ~x3 . We abstract away this dependence in the following condition.
                                                                    33.9

                                             A NANDKUMAR H SU K AKADE
Condition 3 There exist positive scalars N0 , C1,2 , C1,3 , C1,2,3 , and a function f (N, δ) (decreasing
in N and δ) such that for any N ≥ N0 and δ ∈ (0, 1),
           h                                         i
   1. Pr kP̂a,b − Pa,b k2 ≤ Ca,b · f (N, δ) ≥ 1 − δ for {a, b} ∈ {{1, 2}, {1, 3}},
                         h                                                                  i
   2. ∀~v ∈ Rd , Pr kP̂1,2,3 (~v ) − P1,2,3 (~v )k2 ≤ C1,2,3 · k~v k2 · f (N, δ) ≥ 1 − δ.
Moreover (for technical convenience), P̂1,3 is independent of P̂1,2,3 (which may be achieved, say, by
splitting a sample of size 2N ).
For the discrete models such as the document topic model of Section 2.1 and discrete HMMs (Mos-
sel and Roch, 2006; Hsu                     √ Condition 3 holds with N0 = C1,2 = C1,3 = C1,2,3 = 1,
                             p et al., 2009),
and f (N, δ) = (1 + ln(1/δ))/ N . Using standard techniques (e.g., Chaudhuri et al. (2009);
Vershynin (2012)), the condition can also be shown to hold for mixtures of various continuous
distributions such as multivariate Gaussians.
    Now we are ready to present the main theorem of this section.
Theorem 7 There exists a constant C > 0 such that the following holds. Assume the three-view
mixture model satisfies Condition 2 and Condition 3. Pick any  ∈ (0, 1) and δ ∈ (0, δ0 ). Further,
assume Θ ∈ Rk×k is an independent random rotation matrix distributed uniformly over the Stiefel
manifold {Q ∈ Rk×k : Q> Q = I}. If the number of samples N satisfies N ≥ N0 and

4. Applications
In addition to the document clustering model from Section 2, a number of natural latent variable
models fit into this multi-view framework. We describe two such cases in this section: Gaussian
mixture models and HMMs, both of which have been (at least partially) studied in the literature. In
both cases, the estimation technique of Algorithm B leads to new learnability results that were not
achieved by previous works.
4.1. Multi-view and axis-aligned Gaussian mixture models
The standard Gaussian mixture model is parameterized by a mixing weight wj , mean vector µ                         ~j ∈
RD , and covariance matrix Σj ∈ RD×D for each mixture component j ∈ [k]. The hidden dis-
crete random variable h selects a component j with probability Pr[h = j] = wj ; the conditional
                                                            33.10

                           A M ETHOD OF M OMENTS FOR M IXTURE M ODELS AND HMM S
 distribution of the observed random vector ~x given h is a multivariate Gaussian with mean µ                              ~ h and
 covariance Σh .
       The multi-view assumption for Gaussian mixture models asserts that for each component j, the
 covariance Σj has a block diagonal structure Σj = blkdiag(Σ1,j , Σ2,j , . . . , Σ`,j ) (a special case
 is an axis-aligned Gaussian). The various blocks correspond to the ` different views of the data
~x1 , ~x2 , . . . , ~x` ∈ Rd (for d = D/`), which are conditionally independent given h. The mean vector
 for each component j is similarly partitioned into the views as µ                ~ j = (~ µ1,j , µ                ~ `,j ). In the
                                                                                                   ~ 2,j , . . . , µ
 case of an axis-aligned Gaussian, each covariance matrix Σj is diagonal, and therefore the original
 coordinates [D] can be partitioned into ` = O(D/k) views (each of dimension d = Ω(k)) in any
 way (say, randomly).2
       Condition 2 requires that the conditional mean matrix Mv = [~                      µv,2 | · · · |~
                                                                                    µv,1 |~             µv,k ] for each view
 v have full column rank (see Appendix D.2 for a possible relaxation). This is similar to the non-
 degeneracy and spreading conditions used in previous studies of multi-view clustering (Chaudhuri
 and Rao, 2008; Chaudhuri et al., 2009). In these previous works, the multi-view and non-degeneracy
 assumptions are shown to reduce the minimum separation required for various efficient algorithms
 to learn the model parameters. In comparison, Algorithm B does not require a minimum separation
 condition at all.
       Condition 3 can be established for this class of mixture models (in fact, even when the com-
 ponent distributions are simply subgaussian; see Appendix D.3 for details). Therefore, Algorithm
 B can be used to recover the means of each component distribution (and the covariances can be
 recovered as well; see Appendix D.4).
 4.2. Hidden Markov models
 A hidden Markov model is a latent variable model in which a hidden state sequence h1 , h2 , . . . , h`
 forms a Markov chain h1 → h2 → · · · → h` over k possible states [k]; and given the state ht
 at time t ∈ [k], the observation ~xt at time t (a random vector taking values in Rd ) is condition-
 ally independent of all other observations and states. The directed graphical model is depicted in
 Figure 3(b).
       The vector ~π ∈ ∆k−1 is the initial state distribution: Pr[h1 = i] = πi for all i ∈ [k]. For
 simplicity, we only consider time-homogeneous HMMs, although it is possible to generalize to
 the time-varying setting. The matrix T ∈ Rk×k is a stochastic matrix describing the hidden state
 Markov chain: Pr[ht+1 = i|ht = j] = Ti,j for all i, j ∈ [k], t ∈ [` − 1]. Finally, the columns of
 the matrix O = [~o1 |~o2 | · · · |~ok ] ∈ Rd×k are the conditional means of the observation ~xt at time t
 given the corresponding hidden state ht : E[~xt |ht = i] = O~ei = ~oi for all i ∈ [k], t ∈ [`]. Note that
 both discrete and continuous observations are readily handled in this framework. For instance, the
 conditional distribution of ~xt given ht = i (for i ∈ [k]) could be a high-dimensional multivariate
 Gaussian with mean ~oi ∈ Rd . Such models were not handled by previous methods (Mossel and
 Roch, 2006; Hsu et al., 2009).
       The restriction of the HMM to three time steps, say t ∈ {1, 2, 3}, is an instance of the three-view
 mixture model.
 Proposition 8 If the hidden variable h (from the three-view mixture model of Section 3.1) is iden-
 tified with the second hidden state h2 , then {~x1 , ~x2 , ~x3 } are conditionally independent given h,
   2. For product distributions (e.g., axis-aligned Gaussians) satisfying a certain incoherence condition, Condition 2 can
      be established using a random partitioning of the coordinates; see Appendix D.1 for details.
                                                           33.11

                                    A NANDKUMAR H SU K AKADE
and the parameters of the resulting three-view mixture model on (h, ~x1 , ~x2 , ~x3 ) are w ~ := T ~π ,
M1 := O diag(~π )T > diag(T ~π )−1 , M2 := O, and M3 := OT .
From Proposition 8, it is easy to verify that B3,1,2 (~η ) = (U3> OT ) diag(O> ~η )(U3> OT )−1 . There-
fore, after recovering the observation conditional mean matrix O using Algorithm B, the Markov
chain transition matrix can be recovered using the matrix of right eigenvectors R of B3,1,2 (~η ) and
the equation (U3> O)−1 R = T (up to scaling of the columns).

Appendix A. Proofs and details from Section 2
In this section, we provide omitted proofs and discussion from Section 2 (deferring most pertur-
bation arguments to Appendix C), and also present some illustrative empirical results on text data
using a modified version of Algorithm A.

A.5. Some illustrative empirical results
As a demonstration of feasibility, we applied a modified version of Algorithm A to a subset of arti-
cles from the “20 Newsgroups” dataset, specifically those in comp.graphics, rec.sport.baseball,
sci.crypt, and soc.religion.christian, where ~x1 , ~x2 , ~x3 represent three words from
the beginning (first third), middle (middle third), and end (last third) of an article. We used k = 25
(although results were similar for k ∈ {10, 15, 20, 25, 30}) and d = 5441 (after removing a standard
set of 524 stop-words and applying Porter stemming). Instead of using a single ~η and extracting all
eigenvectors of B̂(~η ), we extracted a single eigenvector ξ~x from B̂(~ex ) for several words x ∈ [d]
(these x’s were chosen using an automatic heuristic based on their statistical leverage scores in
 [ Below, for each such (B̂(~ex ), ξ~x ), we report the top 15 words y ordered by ~e>
Pairs).                                                                                                                 ~

The first and fourth topics appear to be about computer graphics (comp.graphics), the fifth and
sixth about baseball (rec.sports.baseball), the third about encryption (sci.crypt), and
the second about Christianity (soc.religion.christian).
    We also remark that Algorithm A can be implemented so that it makes just two passes over the
training data, and that simple hashing or random projection tricks can reduce the memory require-
ment to O(k 2 + kd) (i.e., Pairs
                               [ and Triples \ never need to be explicitly formed).

B.4. Ordering issues
Although Algorithm B only explicitly yields estimates for M3 , it can easily be applied to estimate
Mv for all other views v. The main caveat is that the estimators may not yield the same ordering
of the columns, due to the unspecified order of the eigenvectors obtained in the third step of the
method, and therefore some care is needed to obtain a consistent ordering. However, this ordering
issue can be handled by exploiting consistency across the multiple views.
    The first step is to perform the estimation of M3 using Algorithm B as is. Then, to estimate M2 ,
one may re-use the eigenvectors in R̂1 to diagonalize B̂1,3,2 (~η ), as B1,2,3 (~η ) and B1,3,2 (~η ) share the
same eigenvectors. The same goes for estimating Mv for other all other views v except v = 1.
    It remains to provide a way to estimate M1 . Observe that M2 can be estimated in at least two
ways: via the operators B̂1,3,2 (~η ), or via the operators B̂3,1,2 (~η ). This is because the eigenvalues
of B3,1,2 (~η ) and B1,3,2 (~η ) are the identical. Because the eigenvalues are also sufficiently separated
from each other, the eigenvectors R̂3 of B̂3,1,2 (~η ) can be put in the same order as the eigenvectors
R̂1 of B̂1,3,2 by (approximately) matching up their respective corresponding eigenvalues. Finally,
the appropriately re-ordered eigenvectors R̂3 can then be used to diagonalize B̂3,2,1 (~η ) to estimate
M1 .

B.5. Estimating the mixing weights
Given the estimate of M̂3 , one can obtain an estimate of w           ~ using
                                                  ŵ := M̂3† Ê[~x3 ]
where A† denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of A (though other generalized inverses may
work as well), and Ê[~x3 ] is the empirical average of ~x3 . This estimator is based on the following
observation:
                                 E[~x3 ] = E[E[~x3 |h]] = M3 E[~eh ] = M3 w          ~
and therefore
                                            M3† E[~x3 ] = M3† M3 w   ~ =w ~
since M3 has full column rank.
B.6. Proof of Theorem 7
The proof is similar to that of Theorem 3, so we just describe the essential differences. As before,
most perturbation arguments are deferred to Appendix C.
    First, let E1 be the event in which
                                       kP̂1,2 − P1,2 k2 ≤ C1,2 · f (N, δ),
                                       kP̂1,3 − P1,3 k2 ≤ C1,3 · f (N, δ)
and
                          kP̂1,2,3 (Û3 θ~i ) − P1,2,3 (Û3 θ~i )k2 ≤ C1,2,3 · f (N, δ/k)
for all i ∈ [k]. Therefore by Condition 3 and a union bound, we have Pr[E1 ] ≥ 1 − 3δ. Second, let
E2 be the event in which
                                                                   minj6=j 0 kÛ3> M3 (~ej − ~ej 0 )k2 · δ

                                                        maxj∈[k] kM3~ej k2                             
              λmax := max |hθ~i , Û3> M3~ej i| ≤

Since each θ~i is distributed uniformly over S k−1 , it follows from Lemma 15 and a union bound that
Pr[E2 |E1 ] ≥ 1 − 2δ. Therefore Pr[E1 ∩ E2 ] ≥ (1 − 3δ)(1 − 2δ) ≥ 1 − 5δ.
    Let U3 ∈ Rd×k be the matrix of top k orthonormal left singular vectors of M3 . By Lemma 10
and the conditions on N , we have σk (Û3> U3 ) ≥ 1/2, and therefore

By Lemma 12, the operator B̂1,2,3 (~η1 ) has k distinct eigenvalues, and hence its matrix of right
eigenvectors R̂1 is unique up to column scaling and ordering. This in turn implies that R̂1−1 is unique

Appendix C. Perturbation analysis for observable operators
The following lemma establishes the accuracy of approximating the fundamental subspaces (i.e.,
the row and column spaces) of a matrix X by computing the singular value decomposition of a
perturbation X̂ of X.
Lemma 10 Let X ∈ Rm×n be a matrix of rank k. Let U ∈ Rm×k and V ∈ Rn×k be matrices
with orthonormal columns such that range(U ) and range(V ) are spanned by, respectively, the left
and right singular vectors of X corresponding to its k largest singular values. Similarly define
Û ∈ Rm×k and V̂ ∈ Rn×k relative to a matrix X̂ ∈ Rm×n . Define X := kX̂ − Xk2 , ε0 := σk(X)                      X
                                                                                                                       ,
               ε0                      1
and ε1 := 1−ε0 . Assume ε0 < 2 . Then
    1. ε1 < 1;
    2. σk (X̂) = σk (Û > X̂ V̂ ) ≥ (1 − ε0 ) · σk (X) > 0;
                        p
    3. σk (Û > U ) ≥ 1 − ε21 ;
                        p
    4. σk (V̂ > V ) ≥ 1 − ε21 ;
    5. σk (Û > X V̂ ) ≥ (1 − ε21 ) · σk (X);
    6. for any α̂ ∈ Rk and ~v ∈ range(U ), kÛ α̂ − ~v k22 ≤ kα̂ − Û >~v k22 + k~v k22 · ε21 .
Proof The first claim follows from the assumption on ε0 . The second claim follows from the
assumptions and Weyl’s theorem (Lemma 20). Let the columns of Û⊥ ∈ Rm×(m−k) be an or-
thonormal basis for the orthogonal complement of range(Û ), so that kÛ⊥> U k2 ≤ X /σk (X̂) ≤ ε1
by Wedin’s theorem (Lemma 21). The third claim then follows because kÛ > U k22 = 1 − kÛ⊥> U k22 ≥
1 − ε21 . The fourth claim is analogous to the third claim, and the fifth claim follows from the
third and fourth. The sixth claim follows writing ~v = U α               ~ for some α   ~ ∈ Rk , and using the de-
composition kÛ α̂ − ~v k2 = kÛ α̂ − Û Û ~v k2 + kÛ⊥ Û⊥ ~v k2 = kα̂ − Û >~v k22 + kÛ⊥> (U α
                               2                    >    2            >     2                                  ~ )k22 ≤

the last inequality follows from the argument for the third claim, and the last equality uses the or-
thonormality of the columns of U .
     The next lemma bounds the error of the observation operator in terms of the errors in estimating
the second-order and third-order moments.

where the first inequality follows from the triangle inequality, the second follows from the sub-

claim.
     The following lemma establishes standard eigenvalue and eigenvector perturbation bounds.
Lemma 12 Let A ∈ Rk×k be a diagonalizable matrix with k distinct real eigenvalues λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λk ∈
R corresponding to the (right) eigenvectors ξ~1 , ξ~2 , . . . , ξ~k ∈ Rk all normalized to have kξ~i k2 = 1.
Let R ∈ Rk×k be the matrix whose i-th column is ξ~i . Let Â ∈ Rk×k be a matrix. Define
A := kÂ − Ak2 , γA := mini6=j |λi − λj |, and ε3 := κ(R)·                         A                   1
                                                                                  γA . Assume ε3 < 2 . Then there
exists a permutation τ on [k] such that the following holds:
    1. Â has k distinct real eigenvalues λ̂1 , λ̂2 , . . . , λ̂k ∈ R, and |λ̂τ (i) −λi | ≤ ε3 ·γA for all i ∈ [k];
    2. Â has corresponding (right) eigenvectors ξˆ1 , ξˆ2 , . . . , ξˆk ∈ Rk , normalized to have kξˆi k2 = 1,
        which satisfy kξˆτ (i) − ξ~i k2 ≤ 4(k − 1) · kR−1 k2 · ε3 for all i ∈ [k];
    3. the matrix R̂ ∈ Rk×k whose i-th column is ξˆτ (i) satisfies kR̂−Rk2 ≤ kR̂−RkF ≤ 4k 1/2 (k −
        1) · kR−1 k2 · ε3 .
Proof The Bauer-Fike theorem (Lemma 22) implies that for every eigenvalue λ̂i of Â, there exists
an eigenvalue λj of A such that |λ̂i − λj | ≤ kR−1 (Â − A)Rk2 ≤ ε3 · γA . Therefore, the assumption
on ε3 implies that there exists a permutation τ such that |λ̂τ (i) − λi | ≤ ε3 · γA < γ2A . In particular,

Since Â is real, all non-real eigenvalues of Â must come in conjugate pairs; so the existence of a
non-real eigenvalue of Â would contradict (12). This proves the first claim.
     For the second claim, assume for notational simplicity that the permutation τ is the identity
permutation. Let R̂ ∈ Rk×k be the matrix whose i-th column is ξˆi . Define ζ~i> ∈ Rk to be the
i-th row of R−1 (i.e., the i-th left eigenvector of A), and similarly define ζ̂i> ∈ Rk to be the i-th

Multiplying through the above equation by ζ~j> , and using the fact that ζ~j> ξ~i0 = 1{j = i0 } gives

The above equation rearranges to (λj − λi )ci,j = (λ̂i − λi )ζ~j> ξˆi + ζ~j> (A − Â)ξˆi and therefore

by the Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities and the sub-multiplicative property of the spectral
norm. The bound |ci,j | ≤ 2kR−1 k2 · ε3 then follows from the first claim.
      The third claim follows from standard comparisons of matrix norms.
      The next lemma gives perturbation bounds for estimating the eigenvalues of simultaneously
diagonalizable matrices A1 , A2 , . . . , Ak . The eigenvectors R̂ are taken from a perturbation of the
first matrix A1 , and are then subsequently used to approximately diagonalize the perturbations of the
remaining matrices A2 , . . . , Ak . In practice, one may use Jacobi-like procedures to approximately
solve the joint eigenvalue problem.
Lemma 13 Let A1 , A2 , . . . , Ak ∈ Rk×k be diagonalizable matrices that are diagonalized by the
same matrix invertible R ∈ Rk×k with unit length columns kR~ej k2 = 1, such that each Ai has k

Rearranging gives the claimed inequality.
Lemma 14 Let V ∈ Rk×k be an invertible matrix, and let R ∈ Rk×k be the matrix whose j-th
column is V ~ej /kV ~ej k2 . Then kRk2 ≤ κ(V ), kR−1 k2 ≤ κ(V ), and κ(R) ≤ κ(V )2 .
Proof We have R = V diag(kV ~e1 k2 , kV ~e2 k2 , . . . , kV ~ek k2 )−1 , so by the sub-multiplicative prop-
erty of the spectral norm, kRk2 ≤ kV k2 / minj kV ~ej k2 ≤ kV k2 /σk (V ) = κ(V ). Similarly,
kR−1 k2 ≤ kV −1 k2 · maxj kV ~ej k2 ≤ kV −1 k2 · kV k2 = κ(V ).
      The next lemma shows that randomly projecting a collection of vectors to R does not collapse
any two too close together, nor does it send any of them too far away from zero.

Appendix D. Proofs and details from Section 4
In this section, we provide omitted proofs and details from Section 4.
D.1. Learning mixtures of product distributions
In this section, we show how to use Algorithm B with mixtures of product distributions in Rn that
satisfy an incoherence condition on the means µ    ~ 1, µ            ~ k ∈ Rn of k component distributions.
                                                        ~ 2, . . . , µ
Note that product distributions are just a special case of the more general class of multi-view distri-
butions, which are directly handled by Algorithm B.
    The basic idea is to randomly partition the coordinates into ` ≥ 3 “views”, each of roughly the
same dimension. Under the assumption that the component distributions are product distributions,
the multi-view assumption is satisfied. What remains to be checked is that the non-degeneracy
condition (Condition 2) is satisfied. Theorem 16 (below) shows that it suffices that the original
matrix of component means have rank k and satisfy the following incoherence condition.
Condition 4 (Incoherence condition) Let δ ∈ (0, 1), ` ∈ [n], and M = [~             µ1 |~           µk ] ∈ Rn×k
                                                                                        µ2 | · · · |~
be given; let M = U SV be the thin singular value decomposition of M , where U ∈ Rn×k is a
                            >
matrix of orthonormal columns, S = diag(σ1 (M ), σ2 (M ), . . . , σk (M )) ∈ Rk×k , and V ∈ Rk×k
is orthogonal; and let                                                  
                                                     n         >       2
                                      cM := max         · kU ~ej k2 .
                                             j∈[n] k
The following inequality holds:
                                                  9      bn/`c
                                          cM ≤       ·               .
                                                 32 k · ln `·k   δ
Note that cM is always in the interval [1, n/k]; it is smallest when the left singular vectors in U have
     √
±1/ n entries (as in a Hadamard basis), and largest when the singular vectors are the coordinate
axes. Roughly speaking, the incoherence condition requires that the non-degeneracy of a matrix
M be witnessed by many vertical blocks of M . When the condition is satisfied, then with high
probability, a random partitioning of the coordinates into ` groups induces a block partitioning of

based on the correlations across the two views (similar to CCA). However, their overall algorithm
requires a minimum separation condition on the means of the component distributions. In contrast,
Algorithm B does not require a minimum separation condition at all in this setting.

Proposition 18 (Reduction to sampling with replacement) Consider any m × n matrix A. For
any t ∈ [m], let A et be a random t × n submatrix of A formed by choosing a random subset of t
rows of A uniformly at random without replacement; and let A             bt be a random t × n submatrix of A
formed by choosing a random subset of t rows of A uniformly at random with replacement. Fix any
t ∈ [m] and τ > 0. Then
                                    Pr[σn (A  et ) < τ ] ≤ Pr[σn (A  bt ) < τ ].
Proof This argument is similar to one given by Recht (2009). We first prove that Pr[σn (A               et ) < τ ]
                                     0

    1. First, sample t row indices in [m] uniformly at random without replacement, and select those
       rows in A to form A   et .

 D.2. Relaxation of Condition 2 using higher-order moments
 Even if Condition 2 does not hold (e.g., if µ           ~ v,j ≡ m ~ ∈ Rd (say) for all v ∈ [`], j ∈ [k] so all of
 the component distributions have the same mean), one may still apply Algorithm B to the model
 (h, ~y1 , ~y2 , . . . , ~y` ) where ~yv ∈ Rd+d(d+1)/2 is the random vector that include both first- and second-
 order terms of ~xv , i.e., ~yv is the concatenation of xv and the upper triangular part of ~xv ⊗ ~xv . In this
 case, Condition 2 is replaced by a requirement that the matrices
                 Mv0 := E[~yv |h = 1] E[~yv |h = 2] · · · E[~yv |h = k] ∈ R(d+d(d+1)/2)×k
                                                                                
 of conditional means and covariances have full rank. This requirement can be met even if the means
 ~ v,j of the mixture components are all the same. Extending this to higher-order terms is immediate.

 D.3. Empirical moments for multi-view mixtures of subgaussian distributions
 The required concentration behavior of the empirical moments used by Algorithm B can be easily
 established for multi-view Gaussian mixture models using known techniques (Chaudhuri et al.,
 2009). This is clear for the second-order statistics P̂a,b for {a, b} ∈ {{1, 2}, {1, 3}}, and remains
 true for the third-order statistics P̂1,2,3 because ~x3 is conditionally independent of ~x1 and ~x2 given
 h. The magnitude of hÛ3 θ~i , ~x3 i can be bounded for all samples (with a union bound; recall that
 we make the simplifying assumption that P̂1,3 is independent of P̂1,2,3 , and therefore so are Û3 and
 P̂1,2,3 ). Therefore, one effectively only needs spectral norm error bounds for second-order statistics,
 as provided by existing techniques.
      Indeed, it is possible to establish Condition 3 in the case where the conditional distribution of
~xv given h (for each view v) is subgaussian. Specifically, we assume that there exists some α > 0
 such that for each view v and each component j ∈ [k],

D.4. Recovering the component covariances
While Algorithm B recovers just the means of the mixture components, we remark that a slight
variation can be used to recover the covariances as well. Note that

The conditional independence properties follow from the HMM conditional independence assump-
tions. To check the parameters, observe first that

             M1~ej = E[~x1 |h2 = j] = OE[~eh1 |h2 = j] = O diag(~π )T > diag(T ~π )−1~ej .
The rest of the parameters are similar to verify.
