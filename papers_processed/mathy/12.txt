           Let M be a random nα × n matrix of rank r ≪ n, and assume that a uniformly random
       subset E of its entries is observed. We describe an efficient algorithm that reconstructs M from
       |E| = O(r n) observed entries with relative root mean square error
                                                               1/2

       Further, if r = O(1), M can be reconstructed exactly from |E| = O(n log n) entries. These results
       apply beyond random matrices to general low-rank incoherent matrices.
           This settles (in the case of bounded rank) a question left open by Candès and Recht and
       improves over the guarantees for their reconstruction algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm
       is O(|E|r log n), which opens the way to its use for massive data sets. In the process of proving
       these statements, we obtain a generalization of a celebrated result by Friedman-Kahn-Szemerédi
       and Feige-Ofek on the spectrum of sparse random matrices.
1      Introduction
Imagine that each of m customers watches and rates a subset of the n movies available through a
movie rental service. This yields a dataset of customer-movie pairs (i, j) ∈ E ⊆ [m] × [n] and, for
each such pair, a rating Mij ∈ R. The objective of collaborative filtering is to predict the rating for
the missing pairs in such a way as to provide targeted suggestions.1 The general question we address
here is: Under which conditions do the known ratings provide sufficient information to infer the
unknown ones? Can this inference problem be solved efficiently? The second question is particularly
important in view of the massive size of actual data sets.
1.1     Model definition
A simple mathematical model for such data assumes that the (unknown) matrix of ratings has rank
r ≪ m, n. More precisely, we denote by M the matrix whose entry (i, j) ∈ [m] × [n] corresponds
to the rating user i would assign to movie j. We assume that there exist matrices U , of dimensions
m × r, and V , of dimensions n × r, and a diagonal matrix Σ, of dimensions r × r such that
                                                 M = U ΣV T .                                                    (1)

     Indeed, in 2006, Netflix made public such a dataset with m ≈ 5 · 105 , n ≈ 2 · 104 and |E| ≈ 108 and challenged
the research community to predict the missing ratings with root mean square error below 0.8563 [Net].
                                                         1

For justification of these assumptions and background on the use of low rank matrices in information
retrieval, we refer to [BDJ99]. Since we are interested in very large data sets, we shall focus on the
limit m, n → ∞ with m/n = α bounded away from 0 and ∞.
    We further assume that the factors U , V are unstructured. This notion is formalized by the
incoherence condition introduced by Candés and Recht [CR08], and defined in Section 2. In particular
the incoherence condition is satisfied with high probability if M = U ΣV T with U and V uniformly
random matrices with U T U = m1 and V T V = n1. Alternatively, incoherence holds if the entries of
U and V are i.i.d. bounded random variables.
    Out of the m × n entries of M , a subset E ⊆ [m] × [n] (the user/movie pairs for which a rating
is available) is revealed. We let M E be the m × n matrix that contains the revealed entries of M ,
and is filled with 0’s in the other positions

The set E will be uniformly random given its size |E|.
1.2    Algorithm
A naive algorithm consists of the following projection operation.
Projection. Compute the singular value decomposition (SVD) of M E (with σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ · · · ≥ 0)

                                         M    =          σi xi yiT ,                                 (3)
                                                  i=1
                                              P
and return the matrix Tr (M E ) = (mn/|E|) ri=1 σi xi yiT obtained by setting to 0 all but the r largest
singular values. Notice that, apart from the rescaling factor (mn/|E|), Tr (M E ) is the orthogonal
projection of M E onto the set of rank-r matrices. The rescaling factor compensates the smaller
average size of the entries of M E with respect to M .
    It turns out that, if |E| = Θ(n), this algorithm performs very poorly. The reason is that the
matrix M E contains columns and rows withpΘ(log n/ log log n) non-zero (revealed) entries. The
largest singular values of M E are of order Θ( log n/ log log n). The corresponding singular vectors
are highly concentrated on high-weight column or row indices (respectively, for left and right singular
vectors). Such singular vectors are an artifact of the high-weight columns/rows and do not provide
useful information about the hidden entries of M . This motivates the definition of the following
operation (hereafter the degree of a column or of a row is the number of its revealed entries).
Trimming. Set to zero all columns in M E with degree larger that 2|E|/n. Set to 0 all rows with
degree larger than 2|E|/m.
    Figure 1 shows the singular value distributions of M E and M     fE for a random rank-3 matrix M .
The surprise is that trimming (which amounts to ‘throwing out information’) makes the underlying
rank-3 structure much more apparent. This effect becomes even more important when the number
of revealed entries per row/column follows a heavy tail distribution, as for real data.
    In terms of the above routines, our algorithm has the following structure.

     1: Trim M E , and let M  fE be the output;
     2: Project M  fE to Tr (M fE );

the underlying rank-3 structure becomes clear. Here the number of revealed entries per row follows a heavy
tail distribution with P{N = k} = const./k 3 .
     The last step of the above algorithm allows to reduce (or eliminate) small discrepancies between
Tr (MfE ) and M , and is described below.
Cleaning. Various implementation are possible, but we found the following one particularly appeal-
ing. Given X ∈ Rm×r , Y ∈ Rn×r with X T X = m1 and Y T Y = n1, we define
                                 F (X, Y ) ≡        min F(X, Y, S) ,                                      (4)
                                                   S∈Rr×r

                                                     (i,j)∈E
The cleaning step consists in writing Tr (M fE ) = X0 S0 Y T and minimizing F (X, Y ) locally with initial
                                                                 0
condition X = X0 , Y = Y0 .
     Notice that F (X, Y ) is easy to evaluate since it is defined by minimizing the quadratic function
S 7→ F(X, Y, S) over the low-dimensional matrix S. Further it depends on X and Y only through
their column spaces. In geometric terms, F is a function defined over the cartesian product of
two Grassmann manifolds (we refer to Section 5 for background and references). Optimization
over Grassmann manifolds is a well understood topic [EAS99] and efficient algorithms (in particular
Newton and conjugate gradient) can be applied. To be definite, we assume that gradient descent
with line search is used to minimize F (X, Y ).
     Finally, the implementation proposed here implicitly assumes that the rank r is known. In
practice this is a non-issue. Since r ≪ n, a loop over the value of r can be added at little extra cost.
For instance, in collaborative filtering applications, r ranges between 10 and 30.
1.3      Main results
Notice that computing Tr (M   fE ) only requires to find the first r singular vectors of a sparse matrix.
Our main result establishes that this simple procedure achieves arbitrarily small relative root mean

square error from O(nr) revealed entries. We define the relative root mean square error as

where we denote by ||A||F the Frobenius norm of matrix A. Notice that the factor (1/mn) corresponds
to the usual normalization by the number of entries. The factor (1/r) is instead necessary because
                                                                         √
(as described in Section 2), the typical size of the entries of M is r.
Theorem 1.1. Assume M to be a rank r ≤ n1/2 matrix that satisfies the incoherence condition A2
(in particular, this is the case for random orthogonal matrices U, V ). Then with high probability
                                   1             fE )||2F ≤ C(α) nr .

    The proof is provided in Section 3.
    Notice that the top r singular values and singular vectors of the sparse matrix M       fE can be
computed efficiently by subspace iteration [Ber92]. Each iteration requires O(|E|r) operations. As
proved in Section 3, the (r + 1)-th singular value is smaller than one half of the r-th one. As a
consequence, subspace iteration converges exponentially. A simple calculation shows that O(log n)
iterations are sufficient to ensure the error bound mentioned.
    The ‘cleaning’ step in the above pseudocode improves systematically over Tr (M   fE ) and, for large
enough |E|, reconstructs M exactly.
Theorem 1.2. Assume M to be a rank r ≤ n1/2 matrix that satisfies the incoherence conditions A1
and A2. Further, assume Σmin ≤ Σ1 , . . . , Σr ≤ Σmax with Σmin , Σmax bounded away from 0 and ∞.
Then there exists C ′ (α) such that, if
                                    |E| ≥ C ′ (α)nr max{log n, r} ,                                  (8)
then the cleaning procedure in Spectral Matrix Completion converges, with high probability, to
the matrix M .
    The proof is provided in Section 5. The basic intuition is that, for |E| ≥ C ′ (α)nr max{log n, r},
    fE ) is so close to M that the cost function is well approximated by a quadratic function.
Tr (M
    Theorem 1.1 is optimal: the number of degrees of freedom in M is of order nr, without the same
number of observations is impossible to fix them. The extra log n factor in Theorem 1.2 is due to a
coupon-collector effect [CR08, KMO08, KOM09]: it is necessary that E contains at least one entry
per row and one per column and this happens only for |E| ≥ Cn log n. As a consequence, for rank r
bounded, Theorem 1.2 is optimal. It is suboptimal by a polylogarithmic factor for r = O(log n).
1.4    Related work
Beyond collaborative filtering, low rank models are used for clustering, information retrieval, machine
learning, and image processing. In [Faz02], the NP-hard problem of finding a matrix of minimum
rank satisfying a set of affine constraints was addresses through convex relaxation. This problem is
analogous to the problem of finding the sparsest vector satisfying a set of affine constraints, which
is at the heart of compressed sensing [Don06, CRT06]. The connection with compressed sensing was
emphasized in [RFP07], that provided performance guarantees under appropriate conditions on the
constraints.
                                                     4

     In the case of collaborative filtering, we are interested in finding a matrix M of minimum rank
that matches the known entries {Mij : (i, j) ∈ E}. Each known entry thus provides an affine
constraint. Candès and Recht [CR08] introduced the incoherent model for M . Within this model,
they proved that, if E is random, the convex relaxation correctly reconstructs M as long as |E| ≥
C r n6/5 log n. On the other hand, from a purely information theoretic point of view (i.e. disregarding
algorithmic considerations), it is clear that |E| = O(n r) observations should allow to reconstruct M
with arbitrary precision. Indeed this point was raised in [CR08] and proved in [KMO08], through a
counting argument.
     The present paper describes an efficient algorithm that reconstructs a rank-r matrix from O(n r)
random observations. The most complex component of our algorithm is the SVD in step 2. We were
able to treat realistic data sets with n ≈ 105 . This must be compared with the O(n4 ) complexity of
semidefinite programming [CR08].
     Cai, Candès and Shen [CCS08] recently proposed a low-complexity procedure to solve the convex
program posed in [CR08]. Our spectral method is akin to a single step of this procedure, with the
important novelty of the trimming step that improves significantly its performances. Our analysis
techniques might provide a new tool for characterizing the convex relaxation as well.
     Theorem 1.1 can also be compared with a copious line of work in the theoretical computer science
literature [FKV04, AFK+ 01, AM07]. An important motivation in this context is the development of
fast algorithms for low-rank approximation. In particular, Achlioptas and McSherry [AM07] prove
a theorem analogous to 1.1, but holding only for |E| ≥ (8 log n)4 n (in the case of square matrices).
     A short account of our results was submitted to the 2009 International Symposium on Information
Theory [KOM09]. While the present paper was under completion, Cándes and Tao posted online
a preprint proving a theorem analogous to 1.2 [CT09]. Once more, their approach is substantially
different from ours.
1.5     Open problems and future directions
It is worth pointing out some limitations of our results, and interesting research directions:
     1. Optimal RMSE with O(n) entries. Numerical simulations with the Spectral Matrix Com-
pletion algorithm suggest that the RMSE decays much faster with the number of observations
per degree of freedom (|E|/nr), than indicated by Eq. (7). This improved behavior is a product of
the cleaning step in the algorithm. It would be important to characterize the decay of RMSE with
(|E|/nr).
     2. Threshold for exact completion. As pointed out, Theorem 1.2 is order optimal for r bounded.
It would nevertheless be useful to derive quantitatively sharp estimates in this regime. A systematic
numerical study was initiated in [KMO08]. It appears that available theoretical estimates (including
the recent ones in [CT09]) are for larger values of the rank, we expect that our arguments can be
strenghtened to prove exact reconstruction for |E| ≥ C ′ (α)nr log n for all values of r.
     3. More general models. The model studied here and introduced in [CR08] presents obvious
limitations. In applications to collaborative filtering, the subset of observed entries E is far from
uniformly random. A recent paper [SC09] investigates the uniqueness of the solution of the matrix
completion problem for general sets E. In applications to fast low-rank approximation, it would be
desirable to consider non-incoherent matrices as well (as in [AM07]).

· · · ≥ Σr ≥ 0.
      The matrices U , V and Σ will be said to be incoherent if they satisfy the following properties:

      In the proof of Theorem 1.1, we only require the second incoherence assumption A2. In the
following, whenever we write that a property A holds with high probability (w.h.p.), we mean that
there exists a function f (n) = f (n; α, µ1 ) such that P(A) ≥ 1 − f (n) and f (n) → 0 for µ1 bounded
away from 0 and ∞. In the case of exact completion (i.e. in the proof of Theorem 1.2) f ( · ) can also
depend on µ0 , Σmin , Σmax , and f (n) → 0 for µ0 , Σmin , Σmax bounded away from 0 and ∞.
      Probability is taken with respect to the uniformly random subset E ⊆ [m] × [n]. It is convenient
                                                                                                            √

with high probability |E| ∈ [ǫ α n − A n log n, ǫ α n − A n log n], any guarantee on the algorithm
performances that holds within one model, holds within the other model as well if we allow for a
vanishing shift in ǫ. Finally, we will use C, C ′ etc. to denote generic constants that depend uniquely
on α, µ1 and, when proving Theorem 1.2, µ0 , Σmin , Σmax .
                                                                                                           ′
      Given a vector x ∈ Rn , ||x|| will denote its Euclidean norm. For a matrix X ∈ Rn×n , ||X||F is its
Frobenius norm, and ||X||2 its operator norm (i.e. ||X||2 = supu6=0 ||Xu||/||u||). The standard scalar
product between vectors or matrices will sometimes be indicated by hx, yi or hX, Y i, respectively.
Finally, we use the standard combinatorics notation [N ] = {1, 2, . . . , N } to denote the set of first N
integers.
3       Proof of Theorem 1.1 and technical results
As explained in the previous section, the crucial idea is to consider the singular value decomposition
of the trimmed matrix M       fE instead of the original matrix M E , as in Eq. (3). We shall then redefine
{σi }, {xi }, {yi }, by letting
                                                         min(m,n)
                                                             X
                                             MfE =                  σi xi yiT .                                    (9)
                                                             i=1
Here ||xi || = ||yi || = 1, xTi xj = yiT yj = 0 for i 6= j and σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ · · · ≥ 0.
      We will prove Theorem 1.1 by controlling the operator norm of M − Tr (M                   fE ).
Theorem 3.1. There exists C(α) < ∞ such that, with high probability,
                                     1                                        r 1/2

    This result is proved later in this section. The proof of Theorem 1.1 is a direct application the
of above theorem.
Proof. (Theorem 1.1) Since M − Tr (M     fE ) has rank at most 2r, it immediately follows that
                                                                                          

which implies the thesis.
    To prove Theorem 3.1, we will use following key technical results.
Lemma 3.2. There exists a constant C > 0 such that, with high probability
                                                            

for any x ∈ Rm and y ∈ Rn such that ||x|| = ||y|| = 1.
    The proof of this lemma is given in Section 4. The next lemma, which is a direct consequence of
Lemma 3.2, relates the singular values of the trimmed matrix M             fE to the singular values of M .
Lemma 3.3. There exists a constant C > 0 such that, with high probability
                                         σq                  r 1/2

    We end this section with the proof of Lemma 3.3.
Proof. (Lemma 3.3) Recall the variational characterization of the singular values.
                              σq =              min               max      ||MfE y||                        (13)

Here H is understood to be a linear subspace of Rn .
                                                          7

     Using Eq. (13) with H the orthogonal complement of span(v1 , . . . , vq−1 ), we have, by Lemma 3.2,
               σq ≤      max       fE y

                         ǫ                                               T   fE        ǫ

                    ≤ ǫΣq + C rǫ
     In order to get a lower bound, we use Eq. (14) with H = span(v1 , . . . , vq ). By Lemma 3.2 we
have
               σq ≥      min       fE y

                    ≥ ǫΣq − C rǫ
Combining the upper and lower bounds, we get the desired result.

We want to show that |xT (M     fE − √ ǫ M )y| ≤ C √rǫ for each x ∈ Rm , y ∈ Rn such that ||x|| =
                                        mn
||y|| = 1. Following the technique of [FKS89], this will be done by first reducing ourselves to x, y
belonging to finite sets. We define
                                                       n               

                                  Tn =       x∈ √ Z            : ||x|| ≤ 1 ,
                                                      n
Notice that Tn ⊆ Sn ≡ {x ∈ Rn : ||x|| ≤ 1}. The next two remarks are proved in [FKS89, FO05],
and relate the original problem to the discretized one.
Remark 4.1. Let R ∈ Rm×n be a matrix. If |xT Ry| ≤ B for all x ∈ Tm and y ∈ Tn , then
|x′T Ry ′ | ≤ (1 − ∆)−2 B for all x′ ∈ Sm and y ′ ∈ Sn .
Remark 4.2. |Tm | ≤ (10/∆)m .
     Hence it is enough to show that |xT (M  fE − √ ǫ M )y| ≤ C √rǫ for all x ∈ Tm and y ∈ Tn . There

are two parts to the proof of this claim. One bounds the contribution of light couples L ⊆ [m] × [n],
defined as

In the next two subsections, we will prove that the first contribution is upper bounded by C1 rǫ
                        √                                                                fE − √ ǫ M )y|, this
and the second by C2 rǫ for all x ∈ Tm , y ∈ Tn . Applying Remark 4.1 to |xT (M                 mn
proves the thesis.

where deg(·) denotes the degree (number of revealed entries) of a row or a column. Notice that
A = (Al , Ar ) is a function of the random set E. It is easy to get a rough estimate of the sizes of Al ,
Ar .
Remark 4.3. There exists C1 and C2 depending only on α such that, with probability larger than
1 − 1/n3 , |Al | ≥ m − max{e−C1 ǫ m, C2 α}, and |Ar | ≥ n − max{e−C1 ǫ n, C2 }.
     For the proof of this claim, we refer to Appendix A. For any E ⊆ [m] × [n] and A = (Al , Ar )
with Al ⊆ [m], Ar ⊆ [n], we define M E,A by setting to zero the entries of M that are not in E, those
whose row index is not in Al , and those whose column index not in Ar . Consider the event

with δ ≡ max{e−C1 ǫ , C2 /n} and H(x) the binary entropy function.
     We are now left with the task of bounding P {H(E; A)} uniformly over A where H is defined as

Let Q be an m×n matrix with Qij = 1 if (i, j) ∈ E and i 6∈ Ar , j 6∈ Al (i.e. entry (i, j) is not trimmed
by our algorithm), and Qij = 0 otherwise. Duep             to the incoherence assumption A2, |Mij | ≤ µ1 r 1/2

    For the reader’s convenience, a proof of this fact is proposed in Appendix C. The analogous result
in [FO05] (for the adjacency matrix of a non-bipartite graph) is proved to hold only with probability
larger than 1 − e−Cǫ . The stronger statement quoted here can be proved using concentration of
measure inequalities. The last remark implies that for all x ∈ Tm , y ∈ Tn and for large enough C

the contribution of heavy couples is, w.h.p., bounded by C2 rǫ for some C2 < ∞.
5     Minimization on Grassmann manifolds and proof of Theorem 1.2
The function F (X, Y ) defined in Eq. (4) and to be minimized in the last part of the algorithm
can naturally be viewed as defined on Grassmann manifolds. Here we recall from [EAS99] a few
important facts on the geometry of Grassmann manifold and related optimization algorithms. We
then prove Theorem 1.2. Technical calculations are deferred to section Sections 6, 7, and to the
appendices.
    We recall that, for the proof of Theorem 1.2, it is assumed that Σmin , Σmax are bounded away from
0 and ∞. Constants (denoted by C, C ′ , . . . ) depend implicitly on Σmin , Σmax . Finally, throughout
this section, we use the notation X (i) ∈ Rr to refer to the i-th row of the matrix X ∈ Rm×n or
X ∈ Rn×r .
5.1    Geometry of the Grassmann manifold
Denote by O(d) the orthogonal group of d × d matrices. The Grassmann manifold is defined as the
quotient G(n, r) ≃ O(n)/O(r) × O(n − r). In other words, a point in the manifold is the equivalence
class of an n × r orthogonal matrix A
                                          [A] = {AQ : Q ∈ O(r)} .                                   (18)
For consistency with the rest of the paper, we will assume the normalization AT A = n 1. To represent
a point in G(n, r), we will use an explicit representative of this form. More abstractly, G(n, r) is the
manifold of r-dimensional subspaces of Rn .
    It is easy to see that F (X, Y ) depends on the matrices X, Y only through their equivalence
classes [X], [Y ]. We will therefore interpret it as a function defined on the manifold M(m, n) ≡
G(m, r) × G(n, r):
                                           F : M(m, n) → R ,                                        (19)
                                              ([X], [Y ]) 7→ F (X, Y ) .                            (20)
In the following, a point in this manifold will be represented as a pair x = (X, Y ), with X an n × r
orthogonal matrix and Y an m × r orthogonal matrix. Boldface symbols will be reserved for elements
of M(m, n) or of its tangent space, and we shall use u = (U, V ) for the point corresponding to the
matrix M = U ΣV T to be reconstructed.
    Given x = (X, Y ) ∈ M(m, n), the tangent space at x is denoted by Tx and can be identified with
the vector space of matrix pairs w = (W, Z), W ∈ Rm×r , Z ∈ Rn×r such that W T X = Z T Y = 0.
The ‘canonical’ Riemann metric on the Grassmann manifold corresponds to the usual scalar product
hW, W ′ i ≡ Tr(W T W ′ ). The induced scalar product on Tx between w = (W, Z) and w′ = (W ′ , Z ′ )
is hw, w′ i = hW, W ′ i + hZ, Z ′ i.
    This metric induces a canonical notion of distance on M(m, n) which we denote by d(x1 , x2 )
(geodesic or arc-length distance). If x1 = (X1 , Y1 ) and x2 = (X2 , Y2 ) then
                                                p
                                  d(x1 , x2 ) ≡ d(X1 , X2 )2 + d(Y1 , Y2 )2                         (21)
                                                         11

where the arc-length distances d(X1 , X2 ), d(Y1 , Y2 ) on the Grassmann manifold can be defined ex-
plicitly as follows. Let cos θ = (cos θ1 , . . . , cos θr ), θi ∈ [−π/2, π/2] be the singular values of X1T X2 /n.
Then
                                               d(X1 , X2 ) = ||θ||2 .                                        (22)
The θi ’s are called the ‘principal angles’ between the subspaces spanned by the columns of X1 and
X2 . It is useful to introduce two equivalent notions of distance:
                                1
              dc (X1 , X2 ) = √        min ||X1 Q1 − X2 Q2 ||F                  (chordal distance),          (23)

                                 1
              dp (X1 , X2 ) = √ ||X1 X1T − X2 X2T ||F                           (projection distance).       (24)
                                 2n
Notice that dc and dp do not depend on the specific representatives X1 , X2 , but only on the equiv-
alence classesp[X1 ] and [X2 ]. Distances on M(m, n) are defined through Pythagorean theorem, e.g.
dc (x1 , x2 ) = dc (X1 , X2 )2 + dc (Y1 , Y2 )2 .
Remark 5.1. The geodesic, chordal and projection distance are equivalent, namely
                 2                 1
                   d(X1 , X2 ) ≤ √ dc (X1 , X2 ) ≤ dp (X1 , X2 ) ≤ dc (X1 , X2 ) ≤ d(X1 , X2 ) .             (25)
                π                   2
    For the reader’s convenience, a proof of this fact is proposed in Section D.
    An important remark is that geodesics with respect to the canonical Riemann metric admit an
explicit and efficiently computable form. Given u ∈ M(m, n), w ∈ Tx the corresponding geodesic
is a curve t 7→ x(t), with x(t) = u + wt + O(t2 ) which minimizes arc-length. If u = (U, V ) and
w = (W, Z) then x(t) = (X(t), Y (t)) where X(t) can be expressed in terms of the singular value
decomposition W = LΘRT [EAS99]:
                                   X(t) = U R cos(Θt)RT + L sin(Θt)RT ,                                      (26)
which can be evaluated in time of order O(nr). An analogous expression holds for Y (t).
5.2      Gradient and incoherence
The gradient of F at x is the vector grad F (x) ∈ Tx such that, for any smooth curve t 7→ x(t) ∈
M(m, n) with x(t) = x + w t + O(t2 ), one has
                                F (x(t)) = F (x) + hgrad F (x), wi t + O(t2 ) .                              (27)
In order to write an explicit representation of the gradient of our cost function F , it is convenient to
introduce the projector operator

We have G(X, Y ) = 0 on K(2µ0 ). Notice that u ∈ K(µ0 ) by the incoherence property. Without loss
of generality we can assume x0 ∈ K(2µ0 ), because otherwise we can rescale all lines of X0 , Y0 that
violate the constraint.

     As a consequence of this remark and Theorem 1.1, we can assume that d(u, x0 ) ≤ C r/ ǫ. We
                          √
shall then set γ = C ′ r/ ǫ (the value of C ′ is set in the course of the proof).
     Before passing to the proof of Theorem 1.2, it is worth discussing a few important points con-
cerning the gradient descent algorithm.
   (i) The appropriate choice of γ might seem to pose a difficulty. In reality, this parameter is
       introduced only to simplify the proof. We will see that the constraint d(xk (t), x0 ) ≤ γ is, with
       high probability, never saturated.
                                                      13

  (ii) Indeed, the line minimization instruction 5 (which might appear complex to implement) can
       be replaced by a standard step selection procedure, such as the one in [Arm66].
 (iii) Similarly, there is no need to know the actual value of µ0 in the regularization term. One can
       start with µ0 = 1 and then repeat the optimization doubling it at each step.
 (iv) The Hessian of F can be computed explicitly as well. This opens the way to quadratically
       convergent minimization algorithms (e.g. the Newton method).
5.4     Proof of Theorem 1.2
The proof of Theorem 1.2 breaks down in two lemmas. The first one implies that, in a sufficiently
small neighborhood of u, the function x 7→ F (x) is well approximated by a parabola.
Lemma 5.3. Assume ǫ ≥ A max{r log n, r 2 } with A large enough. Then there exists constants
C1 , C2 , δ > 0 (independent of m, n, ǫ and r) such that, with high probability
                                                     
                        C1 nǫ d(x, u)2 + ||S − Σ||2F ≤ F (x) ≤ C2 nǫ d(x, u)2                        (38)
for all x ∈ M(m, n) ∩ K(3µ0 ) such that d(x, u) ≤ δ (where S ∈ Rr×r is the matrix realizing the
minimum in Eq. (4)).
     The second Lemma implies that x 7→ F (x) does not have any other stationary point (apart from
u) within such a neighborhood.
Lemma 5.4. Assume ǫ ≥ A max{r log n, r 2 } with A large enough. Then there exists constants
C, δ > 0 (independent of m, n, ǫ and r) such that, with high probability
                                   ||grad Fe(x)||2 ≥ C nǫ2 d(x, u)2                                  (39)
for all x ∈ M(m, n) ∩ K(3µ0 ) such that d(x, u) ≤ δ.
     We can now prove Theorem 1.2.
Proof. (Theorem 1.2) Let δ > 0 be such that Lemma 5.3        p and Lemma 5.4 are verified, and C1 , C2
be defined as in Lemma 5.3. We further assume δ ≤ (e1/4 − 1)/C1 . Take ǫ large enough that
                  √
d(u, x0 ) ≤ C r/ ǫ ≤ min(1, (C1 /2C2 )1/2 )δ/10. Further, set the algorithm parameter to γ = δ/4.
     We make the following claims:
    1. xk ∈ K(3µ0 ) for all k.
       Indeed x0 ∈ K(2µ0 ) whence Fe (x0 ) = F (x0 ) ≤ C2 nǫ δ2 . The claim follows because Fe(xk ) is
       non-increasing and Fe(x) ≥ ρ G(X, Y ) ≥ nǫ(e1/4 − 1) for x 6∈ K(3µ0 ).
    2. d(xk , u) ≤ δ/10 for all k.
       Indeed by triangular inequality we can assume to have d(xk , u) ≤ δ/2. Since d(x0 , u) ≤
       (C1 /2C2 )1/2 δ/10, we have Fe(x) ≥ F (x) ≥ F (x0 ) for all x such that d(x, u) ∈ [δ/10, δ]. Since
       Fe(xk ) is non-increasing and Fe(x0 ) = F (x0 ), the claim follows.
     Notice that, by the last observation, the constraint d(xk (t), x0 ) ≤ γ is never saturated, and
therefore our procedure is just gradient discent with exact line search. Therefore [Arm66] this must
converge to the unique stationary point of Fe in K(3µ0 ) ∩ {x : d(x, u) ≤ δ/10, which, by Lemma 5.4,
is u.

    The second term is upper bounded by C ǫ||x′ ||2 ||y||2 using Theorem 1.1 in [FO05] or, equiva-
lently, Theorem 3.3 in the case r = 1. The thesis follows because ||x′ ||2 ≤ ||x||2 .
Proof. (Lemma 5.3) Throughout the proof we assume m = n to simplify notations.
    Let w = (W, Z) ∈ Tu , and t 7→ (X(t), Y (t)) be the geodesic such that (X(t), Y (t)) = (U, V ) +
(W, Z)t+O(t2 ). By setting (X, Y ) = (X(1), Y (1)), we establish a one-to-one correspondence between
the points x as in the statement and a neighborhood of the origin in Tu . If we let W = LΘRT be
the singular value decomposition of W (with LT L = n1 and RT R = 1), the explicit expression for
geodesics in Eq. (26) yields
                          X =U +W ,                 W = U R(cos Θ − 1)RT + L sin ΘRT .                                        (43)
An analogous expression can obviously be written for Y = V + Z. Notice that, if u, x ∈ K(3µ0 ), then
                                                                                                            (i)
(W , Z) ∈ K(12µ0 ) and w ∈ K(48µ0 /π 2 ). In the first case this follows from ||W ||2 ≤ 2||X (i) ||2 +
2||U (i) ||2 . In order to prove w ∈ K(48µ0 /π 2 ), we notice that

Throughout this proof we assume m = n to lighten the notation.
    As in the proof of Lemma 5.3, we let t 7→ x(t) = (X(t), Y (t)) be the geodesic starting at x(0) = u
with velocity ẋ(0) = w = (W, Z) ∈ Tu . We also define x = x(1) = (X, Y ) with X = U + W and
Y = V + Z. Let w  b = ẋ(1) = (W        b be its velocity when passing through x. An explicit expression

is obtained in terms of the singular value decomposition of W and Z. If we let W = LΘRT , we
obtain
                                 c = −U RΘ sin Θ RT + LΘ cos Θ RT .
                                 W                                                                           (52)
An analogous expression holds for Z.   b Since LT U = 0, we have ||W       c ||2 = n||Θ sin Θ||2 +n||Θ cos Θ||2 =
                                                                                 F               F            F

                          = nd(x, u) . In order to prove the thesis, it is therefore sufficient to show
that hgrad Fe(x), wi b ≥ Cnǫ d(x, u)2 . In the following we will indeed show that hgrad F (x), wi           b ≥

Cnǫ d(x, u) , and hgrad G(x), wi   b ≥ 0.
    As a preliminary remark, we notice that w        b ∈ K((3π 2 /2 + 96/π 2 )µ0 ). Indeed
             c (i) ||2 ≤ 2||Θ sin ΘRT U (i) ||2 + 2||Θ cos ΘL(i) ||2 ≤     π 2 (i) 2

At this point the proof becomes very similar to the one in the previous section and consists in lower
bounding A and upper bounding B1 , B2 , B3 . One important fact that we will use is that W              c is well
approximated by W or by W , and Zb is well approximated by Z or by Z. Before proceeding, it is
worth deriving a few estimates of this type. In particular, using Eqs. (43) and (52) we get

The term A0 is lower bounded analogously to E{A2 } in the proof of Lemma 5.3 (see Eq. (44) and
below). Using the eigenvalue bounds Eq. (67) and (68), we obtain A0 ≥ Cnǫd(x, u)2 . As for the
second term we notice that

Therefore for δ ≥ d(x, u) small enough A0 > 2B0 , whence A0 ≥ Cnǫd(x, u)2 /4.

At this point we can apply Lemma the same argument as after Eq. (47). Bounding σmax (S)2 and
using the fact that both W , Zb ∈ K(Cµ0 ) we get

                            ||PE (W S ZbT )||2F = Cnǫ max(r/ ǫ, δ2 )d(x, u)2 .
Putting together Eqs. (79) and (80) we finally get

The upper bound on B2′ is obtained similarly to the the one on B1 . Indeed proceeding as above we
obtain
                        ||PE (U S ZbT + W  c SV T )||2F   ≤ Cnǫd(x, u)2 ,                                        (80)

    Consider now B2′′ . By Theorem 4.1 in [CR08], we have

The first term is bounded using (the analogous of) Eq. (66) and ||S − Σ||F ≤ d(x, u). For the second
                b 2 ≤ Cnd(x, u)2 , thus getting
term we use ||Z||   F
                        B2′′ ≤ Cnǫd(x, u)3 + Cnǫξd(x, u)2 ≤ Cnǫ(δ + ξ)d(x, u)2                                   (84)
whence B2′′ ≤ Cnǫd(x, u)2 /100 for δ small enough. The same argument applies to B2′′′ thus proving

      property if, for any A ⊆ [m] and B ⊆ [n], one of the following is true:

Lemma C.1. The adjacency matrix Q has discrepancy property with probability at least 1 − 1/n.
Proof. The proof is a generalization of analogous result in [FKS89, FO05] which is proved to hold only
with probability larger than 1−e−Cǫ . The stronger statement quoted here is a result of the observation
that, when we trim the graph the number of edges between any two subsets does not increase. Define
Q0 to be the adjacency matrix corresponding to original random matrix M E before trimming. If
the discrepancy assumption holds for Q0 , then it also holds for Q, since eQ (A, B) ≤ eQ0 (A, B), for
A ⊆ [m] and B ⊆ [n].
    Now we need to show that the desired property is satisfied for Q0 . This is proved for the case
of non-bipartite graph in Section 2.2.5 of [FO05], and analogous analysis for bipartite graph shows

D      Proof of remarks 5.1 and 5.2
Proof. (Remark 5.1.) Let θ = (θ1 , . . . , θp ), θi ∈ [−π/2, π/2] be the principal angles between the
planes spanned by the columns of X1 and X2 . It is known that dc (X1 , X2 ) = ||2 sin(θ/2)||2 and
dp (X1 , X2 ) = || sin θ||2 . The thesis follows from the elementary inequalities
                                  1      √
                                    α ≤ 2 sin(α/2) ≤ sin α ≤ 2 sin(α/2)                           (103)
                                  π
valid for α ∈ [0, π/2].
Proof. (Remark 5.2.) We start by observing that
                                                    1
                                    dp (V, Y ) = √        min ||V − Y A||F .                      (104)
                                                     n A∈Rr×r
Indeed the minimization on the right hand side can be performed explicitly (as ||V − Y A||2F is a
quadratic function of A) and the minimum is achieved at A = Y T V /n. The inequality follows by
simple algebraic manipulations.
    Take A = S T X T U Σ−1 /n. Then
                        ||V − Y A||F     =        sup    hB, (V − Y A)i                           (105)

                                         =          sup hU Σ−1 B T , (M − M                       (107)

                                         ≤          sup ||U Σ−1 B T ||F ||M − M                   (108)
                                              n B,||B||F ≤1
On the other hand
              ||U Σ−1 B T ||2F = Tr(BΣ−1 U T U Σ−1 B T ) = nTr(B T BΣ−2 ) ≤ nΣ−2             2
                                                                                    min ||B||F ,
whereby the last inequality follows from the fact that Σ is diagonal. Together (104) and (108), this
implies the thesis.
