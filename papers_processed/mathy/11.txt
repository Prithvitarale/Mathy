                                                 Abstract
      This work considers a computationally and statistically efficient parameter estimation
      method for a wide class of latent variable models—including Gaussian mixture models,
      hidden Markov models, and latent Dirichlet allocation—which exploits a certain tensor
      structure in their low-order observable moments (typically, of second- and third-order).
      Specifically, parameter estimation is reduced to the problem of extracting a certain (orthog-
      onal) decomposition of a symmetric tensor derived from the moments; this decomposition
      can be viewed as a natural generalization of the singular value decomposition for matrices.
      Although tensor decompositions are generally intractable to compute, the decomposition
      of these specially structured tensors can be efficiently obtained by a variety of approaches,
      including power iterations and maximization approaches (similar to the case of matrices).
      A detailed analysis of a robust tensor power method is provided, establishing an analogue
      of Wedin’s perturbation theorem for the singular vectors of matrices. This implies a ro-
      bust and computationally tractable estimation approach for several popular latent variable
      models.

1. Introduction
The method of moments is a classical parameter estimation technique (Pearson, 1894) from
statistics which has proved invaluable in a number of application domains. The basic
paradigm is simple and intuitive: (i) compute certain statistics of the data—often empirical
moments such as means and correlations—and (ii) find model parameters that give rise to
(nearly) the same corresponding population quantities. In a number of cases, the method of
moments leads to consistent estimators which can be efficiently computed; this is especially
relevant in the context of latent variable models, where standard maximum likelihood ap-
proaches are typically computationally prohibitive, and heuristic methods can be unreliable
and difficult to validate with high-dimensional data. Furthermore, the method of moments
can be viewed as complementary to the maximum likelihood approach; simply taking a
single step of Newton-Raphson on the likelihood function starting from the moment based
estimator (Le Cam, 1986) often leads to the best of both worlds: a computationally efficient
estimator that is (asymptotically) statistically optimal.
    The primary difficulty in learning latent variable models is that the latent (hidden)
state of the data is not directly observed; rather only observed variables correlated with
the hidden state are observed. As such, it is not evident the method of moments should
fare any better than maximum likelihood in terms of computational performance: match-
ing the model parameters to the observed moments may involve solving computationally
intractable systems of multivariate polynomial equations. Fortunately, for many classes of
latent variable models, there is rich structure in low-order moments (typically second- and
third-order) which allow for this inverse moment problem to be solved efficiently (Cattell,
1944; Cardoso, 1991; Chang, 1996; Mossel and Roch, 2006; Hsu et al., 2012b; Anandkumar
et al., 2012c,a; Hsu and Kakade, 2013). What is more is that these decomposition problems
are often amenable to simple and efficient iterative methods, such as gradient descent and
the power iteration method.
1.1 Contributions
In this work, we observe that a number of important and well-studied latent variable
models—including Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models, and Latent Dirichlet
allocation—share a certain structure in their low-order moments, and this permits certain
tensor decomposition approaches to parameter estimation. In particular, this decompo-
sition can be viewed as a natural generalization of the singular value decomposition for
matrices.
    While much of this (or similar) structure was implicit in several previous works (Chang,
1996; Mossel and Roch, 2006; Hsu et al., 2012b; Anandkumar et al., 2012c,a; Hsu and
Kakade, 2013), here we make the decomposition explicit under a unified framework. Specif-
ically, we express the observable moments as sums of rank-one terms, and reduce the pa-
rameter estimation task to the problem of extracting a symmetric orthogonal decomposition
of a symmetric tensor derived from these observable moments. The problem can then be
solved by a variety of approaches, including fixed-point and variational methods.
                                             2774

             Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
     One approach for obtaining the orthogonal decomposition is the tensor power method
of Lathauwer et al. (2000, Remark 3). We provide a convergence analysis of this method for
orthogonally decomposable symmetric tensors, as well as a detailed perturbation analysis
for a robust (and a computationally tractable) variant (Theorem 5.1). This perturbation
analysis can be viewed as an analogue of Wedin’s perturbation theorem for singular vectors
of matrices (Wedin, 1972), providing a bound on the error of the recovered decomposition
in terms of the operator norm of the tensor perturbation. This analysis is subtle in at least
two ways. First, unlike for matrices (where every matrix has a singular value decomposi-
tion), an orthogonal decomposition need not exist for the perturbed tensor. Our robust
variant uses random restarts and deflation to extract an approximate decomposition in a
computationally tractable manner. Second, the analysis of the deflation steps is non-trivial;
a naı̈ve argument would entail error accumulation in each deflation step, which we show can
in fact be avoided. When this method is applied for parameter estimation in latent variable
models previously discussed, improved sample complexity bounds (over previous work) can
be obtained using this perturbation analysis.
     Finally, we also address computational issues that arise when applying the tensor de-
composition approaches to estimating latent variable models. Specifically, we show that the
basic operations of simple iterative approaches (such as the tensor power method) can be
efficiently executed in time linear in the dimension of the observations and the size of the
training data. For instance, in a topic modeling application, the proposed methods require
time linear in the number of words in the vocabulary and in the number of non-zero entries
of the term-document matrix. The combination of this computational efficiency and the
robustness of the tensor decomposition techniques makes the overall framework a promising
approach to parameter estimation for latent variable models.
1.2 Related Work
The connection between tensor decompositions and latent variable models has a long history
across many scientific and mathematical disciplines. We review some of the key works that
are most closely related to ours.
1.2.1 Tensor Decompositions
The role of tensor decompositions in the context of latent variable models dates back to early
uses in psychometrics (Cattell, 1944). These ideas later gained popularity in chemometrics,
and more recently in numerous science and engineering disciplines, including neuroscience,
phylogenetics, signal processing, data mining, and computer vision. A thorough survey of
these techniques and applications is given by Kolda and Bader (2009). Below, we discuss a
few specific connections to two applications in machine learning and statistics, independent
component analysis and latent variable models (between which there is also significant
overlap).
     Tensor decompositions have been used in signal processing and computational neuro-
science for blind source separation and independent component analysis (ICA) (Comon and
Jutten, 2010). Here, statistically independent non-Gaussian sources are linearly mixed in
the observed signal, and the goal is to recover the mixing matrix (and ultimately, the orig-
inal source signals). A typical solution is to locate projections of the observed signals that
                                              2775

                      Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, and Telgarsky
correspond to local extrema of the so-called “contrast functions” which distinguish Gaussian
variables from non-Gaussian variables. This method can be effectively implemented using
fast descent algorithms (Hyvarinen, 1999). When using the excess kurtosis (i.e., fourth-order
cumulant) as the contrast function, this method reduces to a generalization of the power
method for symmetric tensors (Lathauwer et al., 2000; Zhang and Golub, 2001; Kofidis and
Regalia, 2002). This case is particularly important, since all local extrema of the kurtosis
objective correspond to the true sources (under the assumed statistical model) (Delfosse
and Loubaton, 1995); the descent methods can therefore be rigorously analyzed, and their
computational and statistical complexity can be bounded (Frieze et al., 1996; Nguyen and
Regev, 2009; Arora et al., 2012b).
    Higher-order tensor decompositions have also been used to develop estimators for com-
monly used mixture models, hidden Markov models, and other related latent variable mod-
els, often using the the algebraic procedure of R. Jennrich (as reported in the article of
Harshman, 1970), which is based on a simultaneous diagonalization of different ways of
flattening a tensor to matrices. Jennrich’s procedure was employed for parameter estima-
tion of discrete Markov models by Chang (1996) via pair-wise and triple-wise probability
tables; and it was later used for other latent variable models such as hidden Markov models
(HMMs), latent trees, Gaussian mixture models, and topic models such as latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) by many others (Mossel and Roch, 2006; Hsu et al., 2012b; Anandkumar
et al., 2012c,a; Hsu and Kakade, 2013). In these contexts, it is often also possible to es-
tablish strong identifiability results, without giving an explicit estimators, by invoking the
non-constructive identifiability argument of Kruskal (1977)—see the article by Allman et al.
(2009) for several examples.
    Related simultaneous diagonalization approaches have also been used for blind source
separation and ICA (as discussed above), and a number of efficient algorithms have been
developed for this problem (Bunse-Gerstner et al., 1993; Cardoso and Souloumiac, 1993;
Cardoso, 1994; Cardoso and Comon, 1996; Corless et al., 1997; Ziehe et al., 2004). A rather
different technique that uses tensor flattening and matrix eigenvalue decomposition has
been developed by Cardoso (1991) and later by De Lathauwer et al. (2007). A significant
advantage of this technique is that it can be used to estimate overcomplete mixtures, where
the number of sources is larger than the observed dimension.
    The relevance of tensor analysis to latent variable modeling has been long recognized in
the field of algebraic statistics (Pachter and Sturmfels, 2005), and many works characterize
the algebraic varieties corresponding to the moments of various classes of latent variable
models (Drton et al., 2007; Sturmfels and Zwiernik, 2013). These works typically do not
address computational or finite sample issues, but rather are concerned with basic questions
of identifiability.
    The specific tensor structure considered in the present work is the symmetric orthogo-
nal decomposition. This decomposition expresses a tensor as a linear combination of simple
tensor forms; each form is the tensor product of a vector (i.e., a rank-1 tensor), and the
collection of vectors form an orthonormal basis. An important property of tensors with
such decompositions is that they have eigenvectors corresponding to these basis vectors.
Although the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of tensors is generally significantly
more complicated than their matrix counterpart—both algebraically (Qi, 2005; Cartwright
and Sturmfels, 2013; Lim, 2005) and computationally (Hillar and Lim, 2013; Kofidis and
                                              2776

             Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
Regalia, 2002)—the special symmetric orthogonal structure we consider permits simple
algorithms to efficiently and stably recover the desired decomposition. In particular, a gen-
eralization of the matrix power method to symmetric tensors, introduced by Lathauwer
et al. (2000, Remark 3) and analyzed by Kofidis and Regalia (2002), provides such a de-
composition. This is in fact implied by the characterization of Zhang and Golub (2001),
which shows that iteratively obtaining the best rank-1 approximation of such orthogonally
decomposable tensors also yields the exact decomposition. We note that in general, ob-
taining such approximations for general (symmetric) tensors is NP-hard (Hillar and Lim,
2013).
1.2.2 Latent Variable Models
This work focuses on the particular application of tensor decomposition methods to estimat-
ing latent variable models, a significant departure from many previous approaches in the
machine learning and statistics literature. By far the most popular heuristic for parameter
estimation for such models is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster
et al., 1977; Redner and Walker, 1984). Although EM has a number of merits, it may suffer
from slow convergence and poor quality local optima (Redner and Walker, 1984), requir-
ing practitioners to employ many additional heuristics to obtain good solutions. For some
models such as latent trees (Roch, 2006) and topic models (Arora et al., 2012a), maximum
likelihood estimation is NP-hard, which suggests that other estimation approaches may be
more attractive. More recently, algorithms from theoretical computer science and machine
learning have addressed computational and sample complexity issues related to estimating
certain latent variable models such as Gaussian mixture models and HMMs (Dasgupta,
1999; Arora and Kannan, 2005; Dasgupta and Schulman, 2007; Vempala and Wang, 2004;
Kannan et al., 2008; Achlioptas and McSherry, 2005; Chaudhuri and Rao, 2008; Brubaker
and Vempala, 2008; Kalai et al., 2010; Belkin and Sinha, 2010; Moitra and Valiant, 2010;
Hsu and Kakade, 2013; Chang, 1996; Mossel and Roch, 2006; Hsu et al., 2012b; Anandkumar
et al., 2012c; Arora et al., 2012a; Anandkumar et al., 2012a). See the works by Anandku-
mar et al. (2012c) and Hsu and Kakade (2013) for a discussion of these methods, together
with the computational and statistical hardness barriers that they face. The present work
reviews a broad range of latent variables where a mild non-degeneracy condition implies
the symmetric orthogonal decomposition structure in the tensors of low-order observable
moments.
    Notably, another class of methods, based on subspace identification (Overschee and
Moor, 1996) and observable operator models/multiplicity automata (Schützenberger, 1961;
Jaeger, 2000; Littman et al., 2001), have been proposed for a number of latent variable
models. These methods were successfully developed for HMMs by Hsu et al. (2012b), and
subsequently generalized and extended for a number of related sequential and tree Markov
models models (Siddiqi et al., 2010; Bailly, 2011; Boots et al., 2010; Parikh et al., 2011; Rodu
et al., 2013; Balle et al., 2012; Balle and Mohri, 2012), as well as certain classes of parse
tree models (Luque et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2012; Dhillon et al., 2012). These methods
use low-order moments to learn an “operator” representation of the distribution, which can
be used for density estimation and belief state updates. While finite sample bounds can be
given to establish the learnability of these models (Hsu et al., 2012b), the algorithms do not
                                              2777

                             Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, and Telgarsky
actually give parameter estimates (e.g., of the emission or transition matrices in the case of
HMMs).
1.3 Organization
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some basic definitions of
tensors. Section 3 provides examples of a number of latent variable models which, after
appropriate manipulations of their low order moments, share a certain natural tensor struc-
ture. Section 4 reduces the problem of parameter estimation to that of extracting a certain
(symmetric orthogonal) decomposition of a tensor. We then provide a detailed analysis of
a robust tensor power method and establish an analogue of Wedin’s perturbation theorem
for the singular vectors of matrices. The discussion in Section 6 addresses a number of
practical concerns that arise when dealing with moment matrices and tensors.
2. Preliminaries
We introduce
        Np            some tensor notations borrowed from Lim (2005). A real p-th order tensor
A ∈               R ni is a member of the tensor product of Euclidean spaces Rni , i ∈ [p]. We
             i=1
                                                                                  np = n, and simply write A ∈ p Rn .
                                                                                                                                N
generally restrict to the case where n1 = n2 = · · · =N
For a vector v ∈ Rn , we use v ⊗p := v ⊗ v ⊗ · · · ⊗ v ∈ p Rn to denote its p-th tensor power.
As is the case for vectors (where p = 1) and matrices (where p = 2), we may identify a
p-th order tensor with the p-way array of real numbers [Ai1 ,i2 ,...,ip : i1 , i2 , . . . , ip ∈ [n]], where
Ai1 ,i2 ,...,ip is the (i1 , i2 , . . . , ip )-th coordinate of A (with respect to a canonical basis).
     We can consider A to be a multilinear map in the following sense: for a set of matrices
{Vi ∈ Rn×mi : i ∈ [p]}, the (i1 , i2 , . . . , ip )-th entry in the p-way array representation of
A(V1 , V2 , . . . , Vp ) ∈ Rm1 ×m2 ×···×mp is
                                                            X
       [A(V1 , V2 , . . . , Vp )]i1 ,i2 ,...,ip :=                       Aj1 ,j2 ,...,jp [V1 ]j1 ,i1 [V2 ]j2 ,i2 · · · [Vp ]jp ,ip .
                                                     j1 ,j2 ,...,jp ∈[n]
Note that if A is a matrix (p = 2), then
                                                     A(V1 , V2 ) = V1> AV2 .
Similarly, for a matrix A and vector v ∈ Rn , we can express Av as
                                                      A(I, v) = Av ∈ Rn ,
where I is the n × n identity matrix. As a final example of this notation, observe
                                               A(ei1 , ei2 , . . . , eip ) = Ai1 ,i2 ,...,ip ,
where {e1 , e2 , . . . , en } N  is the canonical basis for Rn .
     Most tensors A ∈ p Rn considered in this work will be symmetric (sometimes called
supersymmetric), which means that their p-way array representations are invariant to
permutations of the array indices: i.e., for all indices i1 , i2 , . . . , ip ∈ [n], Ai1 ,i2 ,...,ip =
Aiπ(1) ,iπ(2) ,...,iπ(p) for any permutation π on [p]. It can be checked that this reduces to the
usual definition of a symmetric matrix for p = 2.
                                                                   2778

                   Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
                                                    Np n
     The rank   Pk of a p-th order tensor A ∈           R is the smallest non-negative integer k such
that A = j=1 u1,j ⊗ u2,j ⊗ · · · ⊗ up,j for some ui,j ∈ Rn , i ∈ [p], j ∈ [k], and the symmetric
rank P of a symmetric p-th order tensor A is the smallest non-negative integer k such that
A = kj=1 u⊗p                            n           1
                   j for some uj ∈ R , j ∈ [k]. The notion of rank readily reduces to the usual
definition of matrix rank when p = 2, as revealed by the singular value decomposition.
Similarly, for symmetric matrices, the symmetric rank is equivalent to the matrix rank as
given by the spectral theorem. A decomposition into such rank-one terms is known as a
canonical polyadic decomposition (Hitchcock, 1927a,b).
     The notion of tensor (symmetric) rank is considerably more delicate than matrix (sym-
metric) rank. For instance, it is not clear a priori that the symmetric rank of a tensor
should even be finite (Comon et al., 2008). In addition, removal of the best rank-1 approx-
imation of a (general) tensor may increase the tensor rank of the residual (Stegeman and
Comon, 2010).
     Throughout, we use kvk = ( i vi2 )1/2 to denote the Euclidean norm of a vector v, and
                                        P
kM k to denote the spectral (operator) norm of a matrix. We also use kT k to denote the
operator norm of a tensor, which we define later.
3. Tensor Structure in Latent Variable Models
In this section, we give several examples of latent variable models whose low-order moments
can be written as symmetric tensors of low symmetric rank; some of these examples can be
deduced using the techniques developed in the text by McCullagh (1987). The basic form
is demonstrated in Theorem 3.1 for the first example, and the general pattern will emerge
from subsequent examples.
3.1 Exchangeable Single Topic Models
We first consider a simple bag-of-words model for documents in which the words in the
document are assumed to be exchangeable. Recall that a collection of random variables
x1 , x2 , . . . , x` are exchangeable if their joint probability distribution is invariant to permu-
tation of the indices. The well-known De Finetti’s theorem (Austin, 2008) implies that such
exchangeable models can be viewed as mixture models in which there is a latent variable h
such that x1 , x2 , . . . , x` are conditionally i.i.d. given h (see Figure 1(a) for the corresponding
graphical model) and the conditional distributions are identical at all the nodes.
     In our simplified topic model for documents, the latent variable h is interpreted as
the (sole) topic of a given document, and it is assumed to take only a finite number of
distinct values. Let k be the number of distinct topics in the corpus, d be the number of
distinct words in the vocabulary, and ` ≥ 3 be the number of words in each document. The
generative process for a document is as follows: the document’s topic is drawn according to
the discrete distribution specified by the probability vector w := (w1 , w2 , . . . , wk ) ∈ ∆k−1 .
This is modeled as a discrete random variable h such that
                                          Pr[h = j] = wj ,     j ∈ [k].
 1. For even p, the definition is slightly different (Comon et al., 2008).
                                                       2779

                          Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, and Telgarsky
Given the topic h, the document’s ` words are drawn independently according to the dis-
crete distribution specified by the probability vector µh ∈ ∆d−1 . It will be convenient to
represent the ` words in the document by d-dimensional random vectors x1 , x2 , . . . , x` ∈ Rd .
Specifically, we set
             xt = ei       if and only if      the t-th word in the document is i,          t ∈ [`],
where e1 , e2 , . . . ed is the standard coordinate basis for Rd .
      One advantage of this encoding of words is that the (cross) moments of these random
vectors correspond to joint probabilities over words. For instance, observe that
                                          X
                      E[x1 ⊗ x2 ] =             Pr[x1 = ei , x2 = ej ] ei ⊗ ej
                                        1≤i,j≤d
                                          X
                                     =          Pr[1st word = i, 2nd word = j] ei ⊗ ej ,
                                        1≤i,j≤d
so the (i, j)-the entry of the matrix E[x1 ⊗ x2 ] is Pr[1st word = i, 2nd word = j]. More
generally, the (i1 , i2 , . . . , i` )-th entry in the tensor E[x1 ⊗ x2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ x` ] is Pr[1st word =
i1 , 2nd word = i2 , . . . , `-th word = i` ]. This means that estimating cross moments, say, of
x1 ⊗ x2 ⊗ x3 , is the same as estimating joint probabilities of the first three words over all
documents. (Recall that we assume that each document has at least three words.)
      The second advantage of the vector encoding of words is that the conditional expectation
of xt given h = j is simply µj , the vector of word probabilities for topic j:
                              X d                                       Xd
         E[xt |h = j] =             Pr[t-th word = i|h = j] ei =              [µj ]i ei = µj ,  j ∈ [k]
                               i=1                                      i=1
(where [µj ]i is the i-th entry in the vector µj ). Because the words are conditionally inde-
pendent given the topic, we can use this same property with conditional cross moments,
say, of x1 and x2 :
             E[x1 ⊗ x2 |h = j] = E[x1 |h = j] ⊗ E[x2 |h = j] = µj ⊗ µj ,                   j ∈ [k].
This and similar calculations lead one to the following theorem.

             Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
    As we will see in Section 4.3, the structure of M2 and M3 revealed in Theorem 3.1 implies
that the topic vectors µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µk can be estimated by computing a certain symmetric
tensor decomposition. Moreover, due to exchangeability, all triples (resp., pairs) of words
in a document—and not just the first three (resp., two) words—can be used in forming M3
(resp., M2 ); see Section 6.1.
3.2 Beyond Raw Moments
In the single topic model above, the raw (cross) moments of the observed words directly
yield the desired symmetric tensor structure. In some other models, the raw moments do
not explicitly have this form. Here, we show that the desired tensor structure can be found
through various manipulations of different moments.
3.2.1 Spherical Gaussian Mixtures: Common Covariance
We now consider a mixture of k Gaussian distributions with spherical covariances. We start
with the simpler case where all of the covariances are identical; this probabilistic model is
closely related to the (non-probabilistic) k-means clustering problem (MacQueen, 1967).
    Let wi ∈ (0, 1) be the probability of choosing component i ∈ [k], {µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µk } ⊂ Rd
be the component mean vectors, and σ 2 I be the common covariance matrix. An observation
in this model is given by
                                              x := µh + z,
where h is the discrete random variable with Pr[h = i] = wi for i ∈ [k] (similar to the ex-
changeable single topic model), and z ∼ N (0, σ 2 I) is an independent multivariate Gaussian
random vector in Rd with zero mean and spherical covariance σ 2 I.
    The Gaussian mixture model differs from the exchangeable single topic model in the way
observations are generated. In the single topic model, we observe multiple draws (words in
a particular document) x1 , x2 , . . . , x` given the same fixed h (the topic of the document). In
contrast, for the Gaussian mixture model, every realization of x corresponds to a different
realization of h.

The general case is where each component may have a different spherical covariance. An
observation in this model is again x = µh + z, but now z ∈ Rd is a random vector whose
conditional distribution given h = i (for some i ∈ [k]) is a multivariate Gaussian N (0, σi2 I)
with zero mean and spherical covariance σi2 I.

3.2.3 Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
The standard model for ICA (Comon, 1994; Cardoso and Comon, 1996; Hyvärinen and
Oja, 2000; Comon and Jutten, 2010), in which independent signals are linearly mixed and
corrupted with Gaussian noise before being observed, is specified as follows. Let h ∈ Rk be
a latent random vector with independent coordinates, A ∈ Rd×k the mixing matrix, and z
be a multivariate Gaussian random vector. The random vectors h and z are assumed to be
independent. The observed random vector is
                                                    x := Ah + z.
Let µi denote the i-th column of the mixing matrix A.

( i.e., T is the fourth derivative tensor of the function v 7→ 8−1 E[(v > x)2 ]2 , so M4 is the
fourth cumulant tensor). Let κi := E[h4i ] − 3 for each i ∈ [k]. Then

hi is a standard normal random variable. Furthermore, note that A is not identifiable if h
is a multivariate Gaussian.

3.2.4 Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
An increasingly popular class of latent variable models are mixed membership models, where
each datum may belong to several different latent classes simultaneously. LDA is one such
model for the case of document modeling; here, each document corresponds to a mixture
over topics (as opposed to just a single topic). The distribution over such topic mixtures is a
Dirichlet distribution Dir(α) with parameter vector α ∈ Rk++ with strictly positive entries;
                                                                                           Pk

where
                                   α0 := α1 + α2 + · · · + αk .
     As before, the k topics are specified by probability vectors µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µk ∈ ∆d−1 . To
generate a document, we first draw the topic mixture h = (h1 , h2 , . . . , hk ) ∼ Dir(α), and
then conditioned on h, we draw ` words x1 ,P             x2 , . . . , x` independently from the discrete
distribution specified by the probability vector ki=1 hi µi (i.e., for each xt , we independently
sample a topic j according to h and then sample xt according to µj ). Again, we encode a
word xt by setting xt = ei iff the t-th word in the document is i.
     The parameter α0 (the sum of the “pseudo-counts”) characterizes the concentration of
the distribution. As α0 → 0, the distribution degenerates to a single topic model (i.e., the
limiting density has, with probability 1, exactly one entry of h being 1 and the rest are 0).
At the other extreme, if α = (c, c, . . . , c) for some scalar c > 0, then as α0 = ck → ∞, the
distribution of h becomes peaked around the uniform vector (1/k, 1/k, . . . , 1/k) (further-
more, the distribution behaves like a product distribution). We are typically interested in

    Note that α0 needs to be known to form M2 and M3 from the raw moments. This,
however, is a much weaker than assuming that the entire distribution of h is known (i.e.,
knowledge of the whole parameter vector α).
3.3 Multi-View Models
Multi-view models (also sometimes called naı̈ve Bayes models) are a special class of Bayesian
networks in which observed variables x1 , x2 , . . . , x` are conditionally independent given a
latent variable h. This is similar to the exchangeable single topic model, but here we
do not require the conditional distributions of the xt , t ∈ [`] to be identical. Techniques
developed for this class can be used to handle a number of widely used models including
hidden Markov models (Mossel and Roch, 2006; Anandkumar et al., 2012c), phylogenetic
tree models (Chang, 1996; Mossel and Roch, 2006), certain tree mixtures (Anandkumar
et al., 2012b), and certain probabilistic grammar models (Hsu et al., 2012a).

                                E[xt |h = j] = µt,j ,    j ∈ [k], t ∈ {1, 2, 3}
where the µt,j ∈ Rdt are the conditional means of the xt given h = j. Thus, we allow the
observations x1 , x2 , . . . , x` to be random vectors, parameterized only by their conditional
means. Importantly, these conditional distributions may be discrete, continuous, or even a
mix of both.
    We first note the form for the raw (cross) moments.
Proposition 3.1 We have that:
                                          Xk
                    E[xt ⊗ xt0 ] =            wi µt,i ⊗ µt0 ,i ,   {t, t0 } ⊂ {1, 2, 3}, t 6= t0
                                          i=1
                                          Xk
              E[x1 ⊗ x2 ⊗ x3 ] =              wi µ1,i ⊗ µ2,i ⊗ µ3,i .
                                          i=1
    The cross moments do not possess a symmetric tensor form when the conditional distri-
butions are different. Nevertheless, the moments can be “symmetrized” via a simple linear
transformation of x1 and x2 (roughly speaking, this relates x1 and x2 to x3 ); this leads
to an expression from which the conditional means of x3 (i.e., µ3,1 , µ3,2 , . . . , µ3,k ) can be
recovered. For simplicity, we assume d1 = d2 = d3 = k; the general case (with dt ≥ k) is
easily handled using low-rank singular value decompositions.
Theorem 3.6 (Anandkumar et al., 2012a) Assume that {µv,1 , µv,2 , . . . , µv,k } are lin-
early independent for each v ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Define
                                    x̃1 := E[x3 ⊗ x2 ]E[x1 ⊗ x2 ]−1 x1
                                    x̃2 := E[x3 ⊗ x1 ]E[x2 ⊗ x1 ]−1 x2
                                   M2 := E[x̃1 ⊗ x̃2 ]
                                   M3 := E[x̃1 ⊗ x̃2 ⊗ x3 ].
Then
                                              Xk
                                    M2 =          wi µ3,i ⊗ µ3,i
                                              i=1
                                              Xk
                                    M3 =          wi µ3,i ⊗ µ3,i ⊗ µ3,i .
                                              i=1
    We now discuss three examples (taken mostly from Anandkumar et al., 2012c) where the
above observations can be applied. The first two concern mixtures of product distributions,
and the last one is the time-homogeneous hidden Markov model.

                      Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, and Telgarsky
 3.3.1 Mixtures of Axis-Aligned Gaussians and Other Product Distributions
 The first example is a mixture of k product distributions in Rn under a mild incoherence as-
 sumption (Anandkumar et al., 2012c). Here, we allow each of the k component distributions
 to have a different product distribution (e.g., Gaussian distribution with an axis-aligned co-
 variance matrix), but require the matrix of component means A := [µ1 |µ2 | · · · |µk ] ∈ Rn×k
to satisfy a certain (very mild) incoherence condition. The role of the incoherence condition
is explained below.
     For a mixture of product distributions, any partitioning of the dimensions [n] into three
groups creates three (possibly asymmetric) “views” which are conditionally independent
once the mixture component is selected. However, recall that Theorem 3.6 requires that
for each view, the k conditional means be linearly independent. In general, this may not
be achievable; consider, for instance, the case µi = ei for each i ∈ [k]. Such cases, where
the component means are very aligned with the coordinate basis, are precluded by the
incoherence condition.
     Define coherence(A) := maxi∈[n] {e>i ΠA ei } to be the largest diagonal entry of the orthog-
onal projector to the range of A, and assume A has rank k. The coherence lies between k/n
and 1; it is largest when the range of A is spanned by the coordinate axes, and it is k/n when
the range is spanned by a subset of the Hadamard basis of cardinality k. The incoherence
condition requires, for some ε, δ ∈ (0, 1), coherence(A) ≤ (ε2 /6)/ ln(3k/δ). Essentially, this
condition ensures that the non-degeneracy of the component means is not isolated in just
a few of the n dimensions. Operationally, it implies the following.
Proposition 3.2 (Anandkumar et al., 2012c) Assume A has rank k, and
                                                        ε2 /6
                                   coherence(A) ≤
                                                      ln(3k/δ)
for some ε, δ ∈ (0, 1). With probability at least 1−δ, a random partitioning of the dimensions
[n] into three groups (for each i ∈ [n], independently pick t ∈ {1, 2, 3} uniformly at random
and put i in group t) has the following property. For each t ∈ {1, 2, 3} and j ∈ [k], let
µt,j be the entries of µj put into group t, and let At := [µt,1 |µt,2 | · · · |µt,k ]. Then for each
tp∈ {1, 2, 3}, At has full column rank, and the k-th largest singular value of At is at least
   (1 − ε)/3 times that of A.
 Therefore, three asymmetric views can be created by randomly partitioning the observed
 random vector x into x1 , x2 , and x3 , such that the resulting component means for each
 view satisfy the conditions of Theorem 3.6.
 3.3.2 Spherical Gaussian Mixtures, Revisited
 Consider again the case of spherical Gaussian mixtures (cf. Section 3.2). As we shall see
 in Section 4.3, the previous techniques (based on Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.3) lead to
 estimation procedures when the dimension of x is k or greater (and when the k component
 means are linearly independent). We now show that when the dimension is slightly larger,
 say greater than 3k, a different (and simpler) technique based on the multi-view structure
can be used to extract the relevant structure.

                 Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
     We again use a randomized reduction. Specifically, we create three views by (i) applying
a random rotation to x, and then (ii) partitioning x ∈ Rn into three views x̃1 , x̃2 , x̃3 ∈ Rd
for d := n/3. By the rotational invariance of the multivariate Gaussian distribution, the
distribution of x after random rotation is still a mixture of spherical Gaussians (i.e., a
mixture of product distributions), and thus x̃1 , x̃2 , x̃3 are conditionally independent given
h. What remains to be checked is that, for each view t ∈ {1, 2, 3}, the matrix of conditional
means of x̃t for each view has full column rank. This is true with probability 1 as long as
the matrix of conditional means A := [µ1 |µ2 | · · · |µk ] ∈ Rn×k has rank k and n ≥ 3k. To
see this, observe that a random rotation in Rn followed by a restriction to d coordinates
is simply a random projection from Rn to Rd , and that a random projection of a linear
subspace of dimension k to Rd is almost surely injective as long as d ≥ k. Applying this
observation to the range of A implies the following.
Proposition 3.3 (Hsu and Kakade, 2013) Assume A has rank k and that n ≥ 3k. Let
R ∈ Rn×n be chosen uniformly at random among all orthogonal n × n matrices, and set
x̃ := Rx ∈ Rn and Ã := RA = [Rµ1 |Rµ2 | · · · |Rµk ] ∈ Rn×k . Partition [n] into three groups
of sizes d1 , d2 , d3 with dt ≥ k for each t ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Furthermore, for each t, define x̃t ∈ Rdt
(respectively, Ãt ∈ Rdt ×k ) to be the subvector of x̃ (resp., submatrix of Ã) obtained by
selecting the dt entries (resp., rows) in the t-th group. Then x̃1 , x̃2 , x̃3 are conditionally
independent given h; E[x̃t |h = j] = Ãt ej for each j ∈ [k] and t ∈ {1, 2, 3}; and with
probability 1, the matrices Ã1 , Ã2 , Ã3 have full column rank.
     It is possible to obtain a quantitative bound on the k-th largest singular value of each At
in terms of the k-th largest singular value of A (analogous to Proposition 3.2). One avenue
is to show that a random rotation in fact causes Ã to have low coherence, after which we
can apply Proposition 3.2. With this approach, it is sufficient to require n = O(k log k)
(for constant ε and δ), which results in the k-th largest singular value of each At being
a constant fraction of the k-th largest singular value of A. We conjecture that, in fact,
n ≥ c · k for some c > 3 suffices.
3.3.3 Hidden Markov Models
Our last example is the time-homogeneous HMM for sequences of vector-valued observations
x1 , x2 , . . . ∈ Rd . Consider a Markov chain of discrete hidden states y1 → y2 → y3 → · · ·
over k possible states [k]; given a state yt at time t, the observation xt at time t (a random
vector taking values in Rd ) is independent of all other observations and hidden states. See
Figure 1(b).
     Let π ∈ ∆k−1 be the initial state distribution (i.e., the distribution of y1 ), and T ∈ Rk×k
be the stochastic transition matrix for the hidden state Markov chain: for all times t,
                                Pr[yt+1 = i|yt = j] = Ti,j ,   i, j ∈ [k].
Finally, let O ∈ Rd×k be the matrix whose j-th column is the conditional expectation of xt
given yt = j: for all times t,
                                    E[xt |yt = j] = Oej ,    j ∈ [k].
                                                  2787

                            Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, and Telgarsky
Proposition 3.4 (Anandkumar et al., 2012c) Define h := y2 , where y2 is the second
hidden state in the Markov chain. Then
     • x1 , x2 , x3 are conditionally independent given h;
     • the distribution of h is given by the vector w := T π ∈ ∆k−1 ;
     • for all j ∈ [k],
                                    E[x1 |h = j] = O diag(π)T > diag(w)−1 ej
                                    E[x2 |h = j] = Oej
                                    E[x3 |h = j] = OT ej .
     Note the matrix of conditional means of xt has full column rank, for each t ∈ {1, 2, 3},
provided that: (i) O has full column rank, (ii) T is invertible, and (iii) π and T π have
positive entries.
4. Orthogonal Tensor Decompositions
We now show how recovering the µi ’s in our aforementioned problems reduces to the prob-
lem of finding a certain orthogonal tensor decomposition of a symmetric tensor. We start by
reviewing the spectral decomposition of symmetric matrices, and then discuss a generaliza-
tion to the higher-order tensor case. Finally, we show how orthogonal tensor decompositions
can be used for estimating the latent variable models from the previous section.
4.1 Review: The Matrix Case
We first build intuition by reviewing the matrix setting, where the desired decomposi-
tion is the eigendecomposition of a symmetric rank-k matrix M = V ΛV > , where V =
[v1 |v2 | · · · |vk ] ∈ Rn×k is the matrix with orthonormal eigenvectors as columns, and Λ =
diag(λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λk ) ∈ Rk×k is diagonal matrix of non-zero eigenvalues. In other words,
                                             Xk                 Xk
                                    M     =       λi vi vi> =       λi vi⊗2 .                      (1)
                                             i=1                i=1
Such a decomposition is guaranteed to exist for every symmetric matrix.
     Recovery of the vi ’s and λi ’s can be viewed at least two ways. First, each vi is fixed
under the mapping u 7→ M u, up to a scaling factor λi :
                                              X k
                                       M vi =      λj (vj> vi )vj = λi vi
                                               j=1
as vj> vi = 0 for all j 6= i by orthogonality. The vi ’s are not necessarily the only such fixed
points. For instance, with the multiplicity λ1 = λ2 = λ, then any linear combination of v1
and v2 is similarly fixed under M . However, in this case, the decomposition in (1) is not
unique, as λ1 v1 v1> + λ2 v2 v2> is equal to λ(u1 u>             >
                                                      1 + u2 u2 ) for any pair of orthonormal vectors,

             Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
u1 and u2 spanning the same subspace as v1 and v2 . Nevertheless, the decomposition is
unique when λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λk are distinct, whereupon the vj ’s are the only directions fixed
under u 7→ M u up to non-trivial scaling.
    The second view of recovery is via the variational characterization of the eigenvalues.
Assume λ1 > λ2 > · · · > λk ; the case of repeated eigenvalues again leads to similar non-
uniqueness as discussed above. Then the Rayleigh quotient
                                                       u> M u
                                                u 7→
                                                        u> u
is maximized over non-zero vectors by v1 . Furthermore, for any s ∈ [k], the maximizer of
the Rayleigh quotient, subject to being orthogonal to v1 , v2 , . . . , vs−1 , is vs . Another way
of obtaining this second statement is to consider the deflated Rayleigh quotient

                                          u> M − s−1
                                                       P               >
                                                         j=1  λ j vj vj u
                                   u 7→
                                                        u> u
and observe that vs is the maximizer.
    Efficient algorithms for finding these matrix decompositions are well studied (Golub
and van Loan, 1996, Section 8.2.3), and iterative power methods are one effective class of
algorithms.
    We remark that in our multilinear tensor notation, we may write the maps u 7→ M u
and u 7→ u> M u/kuk22 as
                                       u 7→ M u ≡ u 7→ M (I, u),                                    (2)

4.2 The Tensor Case
Decomposing general tensors is a delicate issue; tensors may not even have unique decom-
positions. Fortunately, the orthogonal tensors that arise in the aforementioned models have
a structure which permits a unique decomposition under a mild non-degeneracy condition.
We focus our attention to the case p = 3, i.e., a third order tensor; the ideas extend to
general p with minor modifications.                                          N3 n
    An orthogonal decomposition of a symmetric tensor T ∈                      R is a collection of or-
thonormal (unit) vectors {v1 , v2 , . . . , vk } together with corresponding positive scalars λi > 0
such that
                                                    X k
                                             T =        λi vi⊗3 .                                   (4)
                                                    i=1
Note that since we are focusing on odd-order tensors (p = 3), we have added the require-
ment that the λi be positive. This convention can be followed without loss of generality
since −λi vi⊗p = λi (−vi )⊗p whenever p is odd. Also, it should be noted that orthogonal
decompositions do not necessarily exist for every symmetric tensor.
    In analogy to the matrix setting, we consider two ways to view this decomposition: a
fixed-point characterization and a variational characterization. Related characterizations
based on optimal rank-1 approximations are given by Zhang and Golub (2001).

4.2.1 Fixed-Point Characterization
For a tensor T , consider the vector-valued map
                                              u 7→ T (I, u, u)                                   (5)
which is the third-order generalization of (2). This can be explicitly written as
                                             Xd    X
                              T (I, u, u) =               Ti,j,l (e>       >
                                                                   j u)(el u)ei .
                                             i=1 1≤j,l≤d
Observe that (5) is not a linear map, which is a key difference compared to the matrix case.
    An eigenvector u for a matrix M satisfies M (I, u) = λu, for some scalar λ. We say a
unit vector u ∈ Rn is an eigenvector of T , with corresponding eigenvalue λ ∈ R, if
                                             T (I, u, u) = λu.
(To simplify the discussion, we assume throughout that eigenvectors have unit norm; oth-
erwise, for scaling reasons, we replace the above equation with T (I, u, u) = λkuku.) This
concept was originally   Pintroduced by Lim (2005) and Qi (2005). For orthogonally decom-
posable tensors T = ki=1 λi vi⊗3 ,
                                                    X k
                                     T (I, u, u) =       λi (u> vi )2 vi .
                                                     i=1
By the orthogonality of the vi , it is clear that T (I, vi , vi ) = λi vi for all i ∈ [k]. Therefore
each (vi , λi ) is an eigenvector/eigenvalue pair.
    There are a number of subtle differences compared to the matrix case that arise as a
result of the non-linearity of (5). First, even with the multiplicity λ1 = λ2 = λ, a linear
combination u := c1 v1 + c2 v2 may not be an eigenvector. In particular,
                           T (I, u, u) = λ1 c21 v1 + λ2 c22 v2 = λ(c21 v1 + c22 v2 )
may not be a multiple of c1 v1 + c2 v2 . This indicates that the issue of repeated eigenvalues
does not have the same status as in the matrix case. Second, even if all the eigenvalues
are distinct, it turns out that the vi ’s are not the only eigenvectors. For example, set
u := (1/λ1 )v1 + (1/λ2 )v2 . Then,
                           T (I, u, u) = λ1 (1/λ1 )2 v1 + λ2 (1/λ2 )2 v2 = u,
so u/kuk is an eigenvector. More generally, for any subset S ⊆ [k], the vector
                                                 X 1

                                                 i∈S
is (proportional to) an eigenvector.

             Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
    As we now see, these additional eigenvectors can be viewed as spurious. We say a unit
vector u is a robust eigenvector of T if there exists an  > 0 such that for all θ ∈ {u0 ∈ Rn :
ku0 − uk ≤ }, repeated iteration of the map
                                             T (I, θ̄, θ̄)
                                      θ̄ 7→                  ,                                  (6)
                                            kT (I, θ̄, θ̄)k
starting from θ converges to u. Note that the map (6) rescales the output to have unit
Euclidean norm. Robust eigenvectors are also called attracting fixed points of (6) (see, e.g.,
Kolda and Mayo, 2011).
    The following theorem implies that if T has an orthogonal decomposition as given in (4),
then the set of robust eigenvectors of T are precisely the set {v1 , v2 , . . . vk }, implying that
the orthogonal decomposition is unique. (For even order tensors, the uniqueness is true up
to sign-flips of the vi .)
Theorem 4.1 Let T have an orthogonal decomposition as given in (4).
   1. The set of θ ∈ Rn which do not converge to some vi under repeated iteration of (6)
      has measure zero.
   2. The set of robust eigenvectors of T is equal to {v1 , v2 , . . . , vk }.
The proof of Theorem 4.1 is given in Appendix A.1, and follows readily from simple or-
thogonality considerations. Note that every vi in the orthogonal tensor decomposition is
                                                                                               M θ̄
robust, whereas for a symmetric matrix M , for almost all initial points, the map θ̄ 7→ kM       θ̄k
converges only to an eigenvector corresponding to the largest magnitude eigenvalue. Also,
since the tensor order is odd, the signs of the robust eigenvectors are fixed, as each −vi is
mapped to vi under (6).
4.2.2 Variational Characterization
We now discuss a variational characterization of the orthogonal decomposition. The gener-
alized Rayleigh quotient (Zhang and Golub, 2001) for a third-order tensor is
                                             T (u, u, u)
                                        u 7→               ,
                                              (u> u)3/2
which can be compared to (3). For an orthogonally decomposable tensor, the following
theorem shows that a non-zero vector u ∈ Rn is an isolated local maximizer (Nocedal and
Wright, 1999) of the generalized Rayleigh quotient if and only if u = vi for some i ∈ [k].
Theorem 4.2 Let T have an orthogonal decomposition as given in (4), and consider the
optimization problem
                                 maxn T (u, u, u) s.t. kuk ≤ 1.
                                 u∈R
   1. The stationary points are eigenvectors of T .
   2. A stationary point u is an isolated local maximizer if and only if u = vi for some
      i ∈ [k].
                                              2791

                      Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, and Telgarsky
The proof of Theorem 4.2 is given in Appendix A.2. It is similar to local optimality analysis
for ICA methods using fourth-order cumulants (e.g., Delfosse and Loubaton, 1995; Frieze
et al., 1996).
    Again, we see similar distinctions to the matrix case. In the matrix case, the only local
maximizers of the Rayleigh quotient are the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalue (and
these maximizers take on the globally optimal value). For the case of orthogonal tensor
forms, the robust eigenvectors are precisely the isolated local maximizers.
    An important implication of the two characterizations is that, for orthogonally decom-
posable tensors T , (i) the local maximizers of the objective function u 7→ T (u, u, u)/(u> u)3/2
correspond precisely to the vectors vi in the decomposition, and (ii) these local maximizers
can be reliably identified using a simple fixed-point iteration (i.e., the tensor analogue of
the matrix power method). Moreover, a second-derivative test based on T (I, I, u) can be
employed to test for local optimality and rule out other stationary points.
4.3 Estimation via Orthogonal Tensor Decompositions
We now demonstrate how the moment tensors obtained for various latent variable models
in Section 3 can be reduced to an orthogonal form. For concreteness, we take the specific
form from the exchangeable single topic model (Theorem 3.1):
                                               Xk
                                    M2 =           wi µ i ⊗ µ i ,
                                               i=1
                                               Xk
                                    M3 =           wi µ i ⊗ µ i ⊗ µ i .
                                               i=1
(The more general case allows the weights wi in M2 to differ in M3 , but for simplicity
we keep them the same in the following discussion.) We now show how to reduce these
forms to an orthogonally decomposable tensor from which the wi and µi can be recovered.
See Appendix D for a discussion as to how previous approaches (Mossel and Roch, 2006;
Anandkumar et al., 2012c,a; Hsu and Kakade, 2013) achieved this decomposition through
a certain simultaneous diagonalization method.
    Throughout, we assume the following non-degeneracy condition.
Condition 4.1 (Non-degeneracy) The vectors µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µk ∈ Rd are linearly indepen-
dent, and the scalars w1 , w2 , . . . , wk > 0 are strictly positive.
Observe that Condition 4.1 implies that M2  0 is positive semidefinite and has rank k.
This is often a mild condition in applications. When this condition is not met, learning
is conjectured to be generally hard for both computational (Mossel and Roch, 2006) and
information-theoretic reasons (Moitra and Valiant, 2010). As discussed by Hsu et al. (2012b)
and Hsu and Kakade (2013), when the non-degeneracy condition does not hold, it is often
possible to combine multiple observations using tensor products to increase the rank of the
relevant matrices. Indeed, this observation has been rigorously formulated in very recent
works of Bhaskara et al. (2014) and Anderson et al. (2014) using the framework of smoothed
analysis (Spielman and Teng, 2009).

             Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
4.3.1 The Reduction
First, let W ∈ Rd×k be a linear transformation such that
                                M2 (W, W ) = W > M2 W = I
where I is the k × k identity matrix (i.e., W whitens M2 ). Since M2  0, we may for
concreteness take W := U D−1/2 , where U ∈ Rd×k is the matrix of orthonormal eigenvectors
of M2 , and D ∈ Rk×k is the diagonal matrix of positive eigenvalues of M2 . Let
                                               √
                                        µ̃i :=   wi W > µ i .
Observe that
                                k                                        k
                              X
                                      >
                                          √       √        >
                                                                       X
                M2 (W, W ) =       W ( wi µi )( wi µi ) W =                   µ̃i µ̃>
                                                                                    i = I,
                               i=1                                     i=1
so the µ̃i ∈ Rk are orthonormal vectors.
    Now define M f3 := M3 (W, W, W ) ∈ Rk×k×k , so that
                                   k                          k
                                  X                        X      1
                         M
                         f3 =         wi (W > µi )⊗3 =          √ µ̃⊗3          .
                                                                   wi i
                                  i=1                       i=1
As the following theorem shows, the orthogonal decomposition of M                 f3 can be obtained by
identifying its robust eigenvectors, upon which the original parameters wi and µi can be
recovered. For simplicity, we only state the result in terms of robust eigenvector/eigenvalue
pairs; one may also easily state everything in variational form using Theorem 4.2.
Theorem 4.3 Assume Condition 4.1 and take M          f3 as defined above.
   1. The set of robust eigenvectors of M   f3 is equal to {µ̃1 , µ̃2 , . . . , µ̃k }.
   2. The eigenvalue corresponding to the robust eigenvector µ̃i of M              f3 is equal to 1/√wi ,
      for all i ∈ [k].
   3. If B ∈ Rd×k is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of W > , and (v, λ) is a robust eigen-
      vector/eigenvalue pair of M f3 , then λBv = µi for some i ∈ [k].
The theorem follows by combining the above discussion with the robust eigenvector charac-
terization of Theorem 4.1. Recall that we have taken as convention that eigenvectors have
unit norm, so the µi are exactly determined from the robust eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs of
f3 (together with the pseudoinverse of W > ); in particular, the scale of each µi is correctly
M
identified (along with the corresponding wi ). Relative to previous works on moment-based
estimators for latent variable models (e.g., Anandkumar et al., 2012c,a; Hsu and Kakade,
2013), Theorem 4.3 emphasizes the role of the special tensor structure, which in turn makes
transparent the applicability of methods for orthogonal tensor decomposition.

4.3.2 Local Maximizers of (Cross Moment) Skewness
The variational characterization provides an interesting perspective on the robust eigen-
vectors for these latent variable models. Consider the exchangeable single topic models
(Theorem 3.1), and the objective function
                                  E[(x>        >       >
                                        1 u)(x2 u)(x3 u)]       M3 (u, u, u)
                             u 7→                      3/2
                                                            =                    .
                                          >      >
                                   E[(x1 u)(x2 u)]              M2 (u, u)3/2
                                                                           √
In this case, every local maximizer u∗ satisfies M2 (I, u∗ ) = wi µi for some i ∈ [k]. The
objective function can be interpreted as the (cross moment) skewness of the random vectors
x1 , x2 , x3 along direction u.
5. Tensor Power Method
In this section, we consider the tensor power method of Lathauwer et al. (2000, Remark 3)
for orthogonal tensor decomposition. We first state a simple convergence analysis for an
orthogonally decomposable tensor T .
     When only an approximation T̂ to an orthogonally decomposable tensor T is available
(e.g., when empirical moments are used to estimate population moments), an orthogonal
decomposition need not exist for this perturbed tensor (unlike for the case of matrices),
and a more robust approach is required to extract the approximate decomposition. Here,
we propose such a variant in Algorithm 1 and provide a detailed perturbation analysis. We
note that alternative approaches such as simultaneous diagonalization can also be employed
(see Appendix D).
5.1 Convergence Analysis for Orthogonally Decomposable Tensors
The following lemma establishes the quadratic convergence of the tensor power method—
i.e., repeated iteration of (6)—for extracting a single component of the orthogonal decom-
position. Note that the initial vector θ0 determines which robust eigenvector will be the
convergent point. Computation of subsequent eigenvectors can be computed with deflation,
i.e., by subtracting appropriate terms from T .
Lemma 5.1 Let T ∈ 3 Rn have an orthogonal decomposition as given in (4). For a vector
                          N
θ0 ∈ Rn , suppose that the set of numbers |λ1 v1> θ0 |, |λ2 v2> θ0 |, . . . , |λk vk> θ0 | has a unique largest
element. Without loss of generality, say |λ1 v1> θ0 | is this largest value and |λ2 v2> θ0 | is the
second largest value. For t = 1, 2, . . . , let
                                                T (I, θt−1 , θt−1 )

decomposition. We propose such an algorithm in Algorithm 1, and provide a detailed per-
turbation analysis. For simplicity, we assume the tensor T̂ is of size k × k × k as per the
reduction from Section 4.3. In some applications, it may be preferable to work directly with
a n × n × n tensor of rank k ≤ n (as in Lemma 5.1); our results apply in that setting with
little modification.

      Assume that the symmetric tensor T ∈ Rk×k×k is orthogonally decomposable, and that
T̂ = T + E, where the perturbation E ∈ Rk×k×k is a symmetric tensor with small operator
norm:
                                                      kEk := sup |E(θ, θ, θ)|.

In our latent variable model applications, T̂ is the tensor formed by using empirical mo-
ments, while T is the orthogonally decomposable tensor derived from the population mo-
ments for the given model. In the context of parameter estimation (as in Section 4.3), E
must account for any error amplification throughout the reduction, such as in the whitening
step (see, e.g., Hsu and Kakade, 2013, for such an analysis).
      The following theorem is similar to Wedin’s perturbation theorem for singular vectors
of matrices (Wedin, 1972) in that it bounds the error of the (approximate) decomposition
returned by Algorithm 1 on input T̂ in terms of the size of the perturbation, provided that
the perturbation is small enough.

The proof of Theorem 5.1 is given in Appendix B.
      One important difference from Wedin’s theorem is that this is an algorithm dependent
perturbation analysis, specific to Algorithm 1 (since the perturbed tensor need not have an
                                                                 2796

             Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
orthogonal decomposition). Furthermore, note that Algorithm 1 uses multiple restarts to
ensure (approximate) convergence—the intuition is that by restarting at multiple points,
we eventually start at a point in which the initial contraction towards some eigenvector
dominates the error E in our tensor. The proof shows that we find such a point with high
probability within L = poly(k) trials. It should be noted that for large k, the required
bound on L is very close to linear in k.
    We note that it is also possible to design a variant of Algorithm 1 that instead uses
a stopping criterion to determine if an √iterate has (almost) converged to an eigenvector.
For instance, if T̃ (θ, θ, θ) > max{kT̃ kF / 2r, kT̃ (I, I, θ)kF /1.05}, where kT̃ kF is the tensor
Frobenius norm (vectorized Euclidean norm), and r is the expected rank of the unperturbed
tensor (r = k − # of deflation steps), then it can be shown that θ must be close to one of
the eigenvectors, provided that the perturbation is small enough. Using such a stopping
criterion can reduce the number of random restarts when a good initial point is found early
on. See Appendix C for details.
    In general, it is possible, when run on a general symmetric tensor (e.g., T̂ ), for the
tensor power method to exhibit oscillatory behavior (Kofidis and Regalia, 2002, Example
1). This is not in conflict with Theorem 5.1, which effectively bounds the amplitude of
these oscillations; in particular, if T̂ = T + E is a tensor built from empirical moments, the
error term E (and thus the amplitude of the oscillations) can be driven down by drawing
more samples. The practical value of addressing these oscillations and perhaps stabilizing
the algorithm is an interesting direction for future research (Kolda and Mayo, 2011).
    A final consideration is that for specific applications, it may be possible to use domain
knowledge to choose better initialization points. For instance, in the topic modeling appli-
cations (cf. Section 3.1), the eigenvectors are related to the topic word distributions, and
many documents may be primarily composed of words from just single topic. Therefore,
good initialization points can be derived from these single-topic documents themselves, as
these points would already be close to one of the eigenvectors.
6. Discussion
In this section, we discuss some practical and application-oriented issues related to the
tensor decomposition approach to learning latent variable models.
6.1 Practical Implementation Considerations
A number of practical concerns arise when dealing with moment matrices and tensors.
Below, we address two issues that are especially pertinent to topic modeling applica-
tions (Anandkumar et al., 2012c,a) or other settings where the observations are sparse.
6.1.1 Efficient Moment Representation for Exchangeable Models
In an exchangeable bag-of-words model, it is assumed that the words x1 , x2 , . . . , x` in a
document are conditionally i.i.d. given the topic h. This allows one to estimate p-th order
moments using just p words per document. The estimators obtained via Theorem 3.1 (single
topic model) and Theorem 3.5 (LDA) use only up to third-order moments, which suggests
that each document only needs to have three words.
                                               2797

                        Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, and Telgarsky
     In practice, one should use all of the words in a document               for efficient estimation of the
moments. One way to do this is to average over all 3` · 3! ordered triples of words in a
                                                                       
document of length `. At first blush, this seems computationally expensive (when ` is large),
but as it turns out, the averaging can be done implicitly, as shown by Zou et al. (2013).
Let c ∈ Rd be the word count vector for aP                document of length `, so ci is the number of
occurrences of word i in the document, and di=1 ci = `. Note that c is a sufficient statistic
for the document. Then, the contribution of this document to the empirical third-order
moment tensor is given by
                               d

It can be checked that this quantity is equal to

easily derived for the contribution of the document to the empirical second-order moment
matrix:                                                                

Note that the word count vector c is generally a sparse vector, so this representation allows
for efficient multiplication by the moment matrices and tensors in time linear in the size of
the document corpus (i.e., the number of non-zero entries in the term-document matrix).
6.1.2 Dimensionality Reduction
Another serious concern regarding the use of tensor forms of moments is the need to op-
erate on multidimensional arrays with Ω(d3 ) values (it is typically not exactly d3 due to
symmetry). When d is large (e.g., when it is the size of the vocabulary in natural language
applications), even storing a third-order tensor in memory can be prohibitive. Sparsity is
one factor that alleviates this problem. Another approach is to use efficient linear dimen-
sionality reduction. When this is combined with efficient techniques for matrix and tensor
multiplication that avoid explicitly constructing the moment matrices and tensors (such as
the procedure described above), it is possible to avoid any computational scaling more than
linear in the dimension d and the training sample size.
     Consider for concreteness the tensor decomposition approach for the exchangeable single
topic model as discussed in Section 4.3. Using recent techniques for randomized linear
algebra computations (e.g., Halko et al., 2011), it is possible to efficiently approximate the
whitening matrix W ∈ Rd×k from the second-moment matrix M2 ∈ Rd×d . To do this, one
                                                              0
first multiplies M2 by a random matrix R ∈ Rd×k for some k 0 ≥ k, and then computes the
top k singular vectors of the product M2 R. This provides a basis U ∈ Rd×k whose span
                                                        2798

               Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
is approximately the range of M2 . From here, an approximate SVD of U > M2 U is used to
compute the approximate whitening matrix W . Note that both matrix products M2 R and
U > M2 U may be performed via implicit access to M2 by exploiting (9), so that M2 need
not be explicitly formed. With the whitening matrix W in hand, the third-moment tensor
f3 = M3 (W, W, W ) ∈ Rk×k×k can be implicitly computed via (8). For instance, the core
M
computation in the tensor power method θ0 := M        f3 (I, θ, θ) is performed by (i) computing
η := W θ, (ii) computing η 0 := M3 (I, η, η), and finally (iii) computing θ0 := W > η 0 . Using the
fact that M3 is an empirical third-order moment tensor, these steps can be computed with
O(dk + N ) operations, where N is the number of non-zero entries in the term-document
matrix (Zou et al., 2013).
6.2 Computational Complexity
It is interesting to consider the computational complexity of the tensor power method in the
dense setting where T ∈ Rk×k×k is orthogonally decomposable but otherwise unstructured.
Each iteration requires O(k 3 ) operations, and assuming at most k 1+δ random restarts for
extracting each eigenvector (for some small δ > 0) and O(log(k)+log log(1/)) iterations per
restart, the total running time is O(k 5+δ (log(k) + log log(1/))) to extract all k eigenvectors
and eigenvalues.
     An alternative approach to extracting the orthogonal decomposition of T is to reorganize
                              2
T intoPa matrix M ∈ Rk×k byP        flattening two of the dimensions into one. In this case, if
           k       ⊗3                 k
T =        i=1 λi vi , then M =       i=1 λi vi ⊗ vec(vi ⊗ vi ). This reveals the singular value
decomposition of M (assuming the eigenvalues λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λk are distinct), and therefore can
be computed with O(k 4 ) operations. Therefore it seems that the tensor power method is
less efficient than a pure matrix-based approach via singular value decomposition. However,
it should be noted that this matrix-based approach fails to recover the decomposition when
eigenvalues are repeated, and can be unstable when the gap between eigenvalues is small—
see Appendix D for more discussion.
     It is worth noting that the running times differ by roughly a factor of Θ(k 1+δ ), which
can be accounted for by the random restarts. This gap can potentially be alleviated or
removed by using a more clever method for initialization. Moreover, using special structure
in the problem (as discussed above) can also improve the running time of the tensor power
method.
6.3 Sample Complexity Bounds
Previous work on using linear algebraic methods for estimating latent variable models cru-
cially rely on matrix perturbation analysis for deriving sample complexity bounds (Mossel
and Roch, 2006; Hsu et al., 2012b; Anandkumar et al., 2012c,a; Hsu and Kakade, 2013).
The learning algorithms in these works are plug-in estimators that use empirical moments in
place of the population moments, and then follow algebraic manipulations that result in the
desired parameter estimates. As long as these manipulations can tolerate small perturba-
tions of the population moments, a sample complexity bound can be obtained by exploiting
the convergence of the empirical moments to the population moments via the law of large
numbers. As discussed in Appendix D, these approaches do not directly lead to practical
                                                 2799

                     Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, and Telgarsky
algorithms due to a certain amplification of the error (a polynomial factor of k, which is
observed in practice).
    Using the perturbation analysis for the tensor power method, improved sample complex-
ity bounds can be obtained for all of the examples discussed in Section 3. The underlying
analysis remains the same as in previous works (e.g., Anandkumar et al., 2012a; Hsu and
Kakade, 2013), the main difference being the accuracy of the orthogonal tensor decompo-
sition obtained via the tensor power method. Relative to the previously cited works, the
sample complexity bound will be considerably improved in its dependence on the rank pa-
rameter k, as Theorem 5.1 implies that the tensor estimation error (e.g., error in estimating
f3 from Section 4.3) is not amplified by any factor explicitly depending on k (there is
M
a requirement that the error be smaller than some factor depending on k, but this only
contributes to a lower-order term in the sample complexity bound). See Appendix D for
further discussion regarding the stability of the techniques from these previous works.
6.4 Other Perspectives
The tensor power method is simply one approach for extracting the orthogonal decomposi-
tion needed in parameter estimation. The characterizations from Section 4.2 suggest that a
number of fixed point and variational techniques may be possible (and Appendix D provides
yet another perspective based on simultaneous diagonalization). One important consider-
ation is that the model is often misspecified, and therefore approaches with more robust
guarantees (e.g., for convergence) are desirable. Our own experience with the tensor power
method (as applied to exchangeable topic modeling) is that while model misspecification
does indeed affect convergence, the results can be very reasonable even after just a dozen
or so iterations (Anandkumar et al., 2012a). Nevertheless, robustness is likely more impor-
tant in other applications, and thus the stabilization approaches (Kofidis and Regalia, 2002;
Regalia and Kofidis, 2003; Erdogan, 2009; Kolda and Mayo, 2011) may be advantageous.

    Orthogonal Tensor Decompositions
We give detailed proofs of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 in this section for completeness.
A.1 Proof of Theorem 4.1
Theorem A.1 Let T have an orthogonal decomposition as given in (4).

                 Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
    1. The set of θ ∈ Rn which do not converge to some vi under repeated iteration of (6)
        has measure zero.
    2. The set of robust eigenvectors of T is {v1 , v2 , . . . , vk }.
Proof For a random choice of θ ∈ Rn (under any distribution absolutely continuous with
respect to Lebesgue measure), the values |λ1 v1> θ|, |λ2 v2> θ|, . . . , |λk vk> θ| will be distinct with
probability 1. Therefore, there exists a unique largest value, say |λi vi> θ| for some i ∈ [k],
and by Lemma 5.1, we have convergence to vi under repeated iteration of (6). Thus the
first claim holds.
     We now prove the second claim. First, we show that every vi is a robust eigenvector.
Pick any i ∈ [k], and note that for a sufficiently small ball around vi , we have that for all θ
in this ball, λi vi> θ is strictly greater than λj vj> θ for j ∈ [k] \ {i}. Thus by Lemma 5.1, vi is
a robust eigenvector. Now we show that the vi are the only robust eigenvectors. Suppose
there exists some robust eigenvector u not equal to vi for any i ∈ [k]. Then there exists a
positive measure set around u such that all points in this set converge to u under repeated
iteration of (6). This contradicts the first claim.
A.2 Proof of Theorem 4.2
Theorem A.2 Let T have an orthogonal decomposition as given in (4), and consider the
optimization problem
                                        maxn T (u, u, u) s.t. kuk ≤ 1.

    1. The stationary points are eigenvectors of T .
    2. A stationary point u is an isolated local maximizer if and only if u = vi for some
        i ∈ [k].

for some λ ∈ R, i.e., (u, λ) is an eigenvector/eigenvalue pair of T .
     Now we characterize the isolated local maximizers. Observe that if u 6= 0 and T (I, u, u) =
λu for λ < 0, then T (u, u, u) < 0. Therefore u0 = (1 − δ)u for any δ ∈ (0, 1) satisfies
T (u0 , u0 , u0 ) = (1 − δ)3 T (u, u, u) > T (u, u, u). So such a u cannot be a local maximizer.

Moreover, if kuk < 1 and T (I, u, u) = λu for λ > 0, then u0 = (1 + δ)u for a small enough
δ ∈ (0, 1) satisfies ku0 k ≤ 1 and T (u0 , u0 , u0 ) = (1 + δ)3 T (u, u, u) > T (u, u, u). Therefore a
local maximizer must have T (I, u, u) = λu for some λ ≥ 0, and kuk = 1 whenever λ > 0.

where Ω := {i ∈ [k] : ci 6= 0}. This implies that for any unit vector w ∈ Rn ,

The point u is an isolated local maximum if the above quantity is strictly negative for all
unit vectors w orthogonal to u. We now consider three cases depending on the cardinality
of Ω and the sign of λ.
    • Case 1: |Ω| = 1 and λ > 0. This means u = vi for some i ∈ [k] (as u = −vi implies
      λ = −λi < 0). In this case,
                              w> ∇2u L(u, λ)w = 3λi (2(vi> w)2 − 1) = −3λi < 0
      for all w ∈ Rn satisfying (u> w)2 = (vi> w)2 = 0. Hence u is an isolated local maximizer.

      that ũ := 1 − δ 2 u + δvj is contained in U . Then

      for sufficiently small δ. Thus u is not an isolated local maximizer.
From these exhaustive cases, we conclude that a stationary point u is an isolated local
maximizer if and only if u = vi for some i ∈ [k].
    We are grateful to Hanzhang Hu, Drew Bagnell, and Martial Hebert for alerting us of
an issue with our original statement of Theorem 4.2 and its proof, and for suggesting a
simple fix. The original statement used the optimization constraint kuk = 1 (rather than
kuk ≤ 1), but the characterization of the decomposition with this constraint is then only
given by isolated local maximizers u with the additional constraint that T (u, u, u) > 0—that
is, there can be isolated local maximizers with T (u, u, u) ≤ 0 that are not vectors in the
decomposition. The suggested fix of Hu, Bagnell, and Herbert is to relax to kuk ≤ 1, which
eliminates isolated local maximizers with T (u, u, u) ≤ 0; this way, the characterization of
the decomposition is simply the isolated local maximizers under the relaxed constraint.

Appendix B. Analysis of Robust Power Method
In this section, we prove Theorem 5.1. The proof is structured as follows. In Appendix B.1,
we show that with high probability, at least one out of L random vectors will be a good
initializer for the tensor power iterations. An initializer is good if its projection onto an
eigenvector is noticeably larger than its projection onto other eigenvectors. We then analyze
in Appendix B.2 the convergence behavior of the tensor power iterations. Relative to the
proof of Lemma 5.1, this analysis is complicated by the tensor perturbation. We show that
there is an initial slow convergence phase (linear rate rather than quadratic), but as soon
as the projection of the iterate onto an eigenvector is large enough, it enters the quadratic
convergence regime until the perturbation dominates. Finally, we show how errors accrue
due to deflation in Appendix B.3, which is rather subtle and different from deflation with
matrix eigendecompositions. This is because when some initial set of eigenvectors and
eigenvalues are accurately recovered, the additional errors due to deflation are effectively
only lower-order terms. These three pieces are assembled in Appendix B.4 to complete the
proof of Theorem 5.1.
B.1 Initialization
Consider a set of non-negative numbers λ̃1 , λ̃2 , . . . , λ̃k ≥ 0. For γ ∈ (0, 1), we say a unit
vector θ0 ∈ Rk is γ-separated relative to i∗ ∈ [k] if
                              λ̃i∗ |θi∗ ,0 | −   max λ̃i |θi,0 | ≥ γ λ̃i |θi∗ ,0 |

(the dependence on λ̃1 , λ̃2 , . . . , λ̃k is implicit).
    The following lemma shows that for any constant γ, with probability at least 1 − η,
at least one out of poly(k) log(1/η) i.i.d. random vectors (uniformly distributed over the
unit sphere S k−1 ) is γ-separated relative to arg maxi∈[k] λ̃i . (For small enough γ and large
enough k, the polynomial is close to linear in k.)

the following holds. With probability at least 1/2 over the choice of L i.i.d. random vectors
drawn uniformly distributed over the unit sphere S k−1 in Rk , at least one of the vectors is
γ-separated relative to arg maxi∈[k] λ̃i . Moreover, with the same c, L, and for any η ∈ (0, 1),
with probability at least 1 − η over L · log2 (1/η) i.i.d. uniform random unit vectors, at least
one of the vectors is γ-separated.
Proof Without loss of generality, assume arg maxi∈[k] λ̃i = 1. Consider a random matrix
Z ∈ Rk×L whose entries are independent N (0, 1) random variables; we take the j-th column
of Z to be comprised of the random variables used for the j-th random vector (before

                Tensor Decompositions for Learning Latent Variable Models
It suffices to show that with probability at least 1/2, there is a column j ∗ ∈ [L] such that
                                                    1
                                     |Z1,j ∗ | ≥           max |Zi,j ∗ |.
                                                  1 − γ i∈[k]\{1}
     Since maxj∈[L] |Z1,j | is a 1-Lipschitz function of L independent N (0, 1) random variables,
it follows that
                                                  h              i                  
                                                                        p
                     Pr max |Z1,j | − median max |Z1,j | > 2 ln(8) ≤ 1/4.
                          j∈[L]                      j∈[L]
Moreover,                          h              i              h            i
                           median max |Z1,j | ≥ median max Z1,j =: m.
                                     j∈[L]                         j∈[L]
Observe that the cumulative distribution function of maxj∈[L] Z1,j is given by F (z) = Φ(z)L ,
where Φ is the standard Gaussian CDF. Since F (m) = 1/2, it follows that m = Φ−1 (2−1/L ).
It can be checked that
                                                                  ln(ln(L)) + c
                                Φ−1 (2−1/L ) ≥ 2 ln(L) − p

                                                                    2 2 ln(L)
for some absolute constant c > 0. Also, let j ∗ := arg maxj∈[L] |Z1,j |.
     Now for each j ∈ [L], let |Z2:k,j | := max{|Z2,j |, |Z3,j |, . . . , |Zk,j |}. Again, since |Z2:k,j | is
a 1-Lipschitz function of k − 1 independent N (0, 1) random variables, it follows that
                                               h         i p              
                             Pr |Z2:k,j | > E |Z2:k,j | + 2 ln(4) ≤ 1/4.
Moreover, by a standard argument,
                                            h         i p
                                         E |Z2:k,j | ≤ 2 ln(k).
Since |Z2:k,j | is independent of |Z1,j | for all j ∈ [L], it follows that the previous two displayed
inequalities also hold with j replaced by j ∗ .
     Therefore we conclude with a union bound that with probability at least 1/2,
                p            ln(ln(L)) + c p                                           p           p
    |Z1,j ∗ | ≥   2 ln(L) − p                  − 2 ln(8)       and |Z2:k,j ∗ | ≤          2 ln(k) + 2 ln(4).
                              2 2 ln(L)
Since L satisfies (10) by assumption, in this event, the j ∗ -th random vector is γ-separated.

where {v1 , v2 , . . . , vk } is an orthonormal basis, and, without loss of generality,

Also, define

    We further assume the error Ẽ is a symmetric tensor such that, for some constant p > 1,
                       kẼ(I, u, u)k ≤ ˜,        ∀u ∈ S k−1 ;                                                    (12)

In the next two propositions (Propositions B.1 and B.2) and next two lemmas (Lemmas B.2

only the property (12) of Ẽ. But throughout, the quantity ˜ can be replaced by ˜/p if θt
satisfies (θt> v1 )2 ≥ 1 − (3˜      /λ̃1 )2 as per property (13).

B.2.1 Approximate Recovery of a Single Eigenvector
We now state the main result regarding the approximate recovery of a single eigenvector
using the tensor power method on T̃ . Here, we exploit the special properties of the error
Ẽ—both (12) and (13).

Proof Assume without loss of generality that i∗ = 1. We consider three phases: (i)
iterations before the first time t such that Rt > 1 + 2κρ2 = 1 + 8κ (using ρ := 2), (ii) the
subsequent iterations before the first time t such that Rt ≥ 1/α (where α will be defined
below), and finally (iii) the remaining iterations.
     We begin by analyzing the first phase, i.e., the iterates in T1 := {t ≥ 0 : Rt ≤ 1+2κρ2 =
1 + 8κ}. Observe that the condition on ˜ implies
                                                                                                        

and hence the preconditions on δt and γt of Lemma B.2 hold for t = 0. For all t ∈ T1
satisfying the preconditions, Lemma B.2 implies that δt+1 ≤ δt and γt+1 ≥ min{γt , 1 − 1/ρ},
so the next iteration also satisfies the preconditions. Hence by induction, the preconditions
hold for all iterations in T1 . Moreover, for all i ∈ [k], we have

number of iterations in T2 , observe that Rt increases at a quadratic rate until Rt ≥ 1/α, so

Therefore, the preconditions of Lemma B.3 are satisfied for the initial iteration t00 in this
final phase, and by the same arguments as before, the preconditions hold for all subsequent
iterations t ≥ t00 . Initially, we have Rt00 ≥ 1/α ≥ 1/β, and by Lemma B.3, we have that Rt
increases at a quadratic rate in this final phase until Rt ≥ 1/α. So the number of iterations
before Rt ≥ 1/α can be bounded as

is the projection of v̂i onto the subspace orthogonal to vi . Since kv̂i − vi k2 = 2(1 − vi> v̂i ), it
follows that

(the inequality follows from the assumption kv̂i −vi k ≤ 2, which in turn implies 0 ≤ ci ≤ 1).
By the Pythagorean theorem and the above inequality for ci ,

Later, we will also need the following bound, which is easily derived from the above inequal-
ities and the triangle inequality:

where the first inequality uses the fact (x + y)2 ≤ 2(x2 + y 2 ) and the triangle inequality,
and the second inequality uses the orthonormality of the vi and the triangle inequality.
     It remains to bound A2i and |Bi | in terms of |ai |, λi , and ˜. The first term, A2i , can be
bounded using the triangle inequality and the various bounds on |λi − λ̂i |, kv̂i − vi k, kv̂i⊥ k,

and therefore (via (x + y)2 ≤ 2(x2 + y 2 ))

The second term, |Bi |, is bounded similarly:

This means that θN is (1/4)-separated relative to π(j ∗ ). Also, observe that

Therefore by Lemma B.4 (using ˜/p := 2, γ := 1/4, and κ := 5/4), executing another N
power iterations starting from θN gives a vector θ̂ that satisfies

Since v̂i = θ̂ and λ̂i = λ̂, the first assertion of the inductive hypothesis is satisfied, as we
can modify the permutation π by swapping π(i) and π(j ∗ ) without affecting the values of
{π(j) : j ≤ i − 1} (recall j ∗ ≥ i).
    We now argue that Ẽi+1 has the required properties to complete the inductive step. By

Appendix C. Variant of Robust Power Method that uses a Stopping
     Condition
In this section we analyze a variant of Algorithm 1 that uses a stopping condition. The
variant is described in Algorithm 2. The key difference is that the inner for-loop is repeated
until a stopping condition is satisfied (rather than explicitly L times). The stopping condi-
tion ensures that the power iteration is converging to an eigenvector, and it will be satisfied
within poly(k) random restarts with high probability. The condition depends on one new
quantity, r, which should be set to r := k − # deflation steps so far (i.e., the first call to
Algorithm 2 uses r = k, the second call uses r = k − 1, and so on).

Therefore the stopping condition (31) is satisfied.
C.2 Sketch of Analysis of Algorithm 2
The analysis of Algorithm 2 is very similar to the proof of Theorem 5.1 for Algorithm 1, so
here we just sketch the essential differences.
     First, the guarantee afforded to Algorithm 2 is somewhat different than Theorem 5.1.
Specifically, it is of the following form: (i) under appropriate conditions, upon termination,
the algorithm returns an accurate decomposition, and (ii) the algorithm terminates after
poly(k) random restarts with high probability.
     The conditions on  and N are the same (but for possibly different universal constants
C1 , C2 ). In Lemma C.1 and Lemma C.2, there is reference to a condition on the Frobenius
norm of E, but we may use the inequality kEkF ≤ kkEk ≤ k so that the condition is
subsumed by the  condition.
     Now we outline the differences relative to the proof of Theorem 5.1. The basic structure
of the induction argument is the same. In the induction step, we argue that (i) if the
stopping condition is satisfied, then by Lemma C.1 (with α = 0.05 and β = 1/2), we have
a vector θN such that, for some j ∗ ≥ i,
                              √
   1. λπ(j ∗ ) ≥ λπ(jmax ) /(4 k);
   2. θN is (1/4)-separated relative to π(j ∗ );
   3. θπ(j ∗ ),N ≥ 4/5;
and (ii) the stopping condition is satisfied within poly(k) random restarts (via Lemma B.1
and Lemma C.2) with high probability. We now invoke Lemma B.4 to argue that executing
another N power iterations starting from θN gives a vector θ̂ that satisfies
                                                    8
                             kθ̂ − vπ(j ∗ ) k ≤            ,     |λ̂ − λπ(j ∗ ) | ≤ 5.
                                                  λπ(j ∗ )
                                                                                              √
The main difference here, relative to the proof of Theorem 5.1, is that we use κ := 4 k
(rather than κ = O(1)), but this ultimately leads to the same guarantee after taking into
consideration the condition  ≤ C1 λmin /k. The remainder of the analysis is essentially the
same as the proof of Theorem 5.1.

Appendix D. Simultaneous Diagonalization for Tensor Decomposition
As discussed in the introduction, another standard approach to certain tensor decomposition
problems is to simultaneously diagonalize a collection of similar matrices obtained from the
given tensor. We now examine this approach in the context of our latent variable models,
where
                                                     X k
                                         M2 =             wi µ i ⊗ µ i
                                                     i=1
                                                     X k
                                         M3 =             wi µ i ⊗ µ i ⊗ µ i .
                                                     i=1
Let V := [µ1 |µ2 | · · · |µk ] and D(η) := diag(µ>              >             >
                                                          1 η, µ2 η, . . . , µk η), so
                                        M2 = V diag(w1 , w2 , . . . wk )V >
                            M3 (I, I, η) = V diag(w1 , w2 , . . . wk )D(η)V >
Thus, the problem of determining the µi can be cast as a simultaneous diagonalization
problem: find a matrix X such that X > M2 X and X > M3 (I, I, η)X (for all η) are diagonal.
It is easy to see that if the µi are linearly independent, then the solution X > = V † is unique
up to permutation and rescaling of the columns.
     With exact moments, a simple approach is as follows. Assume for simplicity that d = k,
and define
                                 M (η) := M3 (I, I, η)M2−1 = V D(η)V −1 .
Observe that if the diagonal entries of D(η) are distinct, then the eigenvectors of M (η) are
the columns of V (up to permutation and scaling). This criterion is satisfied almost surely
when η is chosen randomly from a continuous distribution over Rk .
     The above technique (or some variant thereof) was previously used to give the efficient
learnability results, where the computational and sample complexity bounds were polyno-
mial in relevant parameters of the problem, including the rank parameter k (Mossel and
Roch, 2006; Anandkumar et al., 2012c,a; Hsu and Kakade, 2013). However, the specific
polynomial dependence on k was rather large due to the need for the diagonal entries of
D(η) to be well-separated. This is because with finite samples, M (η) is only known up
to some perturbation, and thus the sample complexity bound depends inversely in (some
polynomial of) the separation of the diagonal entries of D(η). With η drawn uniformly
at random from the unit sphere in Rk , the separation was only guaranteed to be roughly
1/k 2.5 (Anandkumar et al., 2012c) (while this may be a loose estimate, the instability is ob-
served in practice). In contrast, using the tensor power method to approximately recover V
(and hence the model parameters µi and wi ) requires only a mild, lower-order dependence
on k.
     It should be noted, however, that the use of a single random choice of η is quite restric-
tive, and it is easy to see that a simultaneous diagonalization of M (η) for several choices
of η can be beneficial. While the uniqueness of the eigendecomposition of M (η) is only
guaranteed when the diagonal entries of D(η) are distinct, the simultaneous diagonaliza-
tion of M (η (1) ), M (η (2) ), . . . , M (η (m) ) for vectors η (1) , η (2) , . . . , η (m) is unique as long as the

are distinct (i.e., for each pair of column indices i, j, there exists a row index r such that
the (r, i)-th and (r, j)-th entries are distinct). This is a much weaker requirement for
uniqueness, and therefore may translate to an improved perturbation analysis. In fact, using
the techniques discussed in Section 4.3, we may even reduce the problem to an orthogonal
simultaneous diagonalization, which may be easier to obtain. Furthermore, a number of
robust numerical methods for (approximately) simultaneously diagonalizing collections of
matrices have been proposed and used successfully in the literature (e.g., Bunse-Gerstner
et al., 1993; Cardoso and Souloumiac, 1993; Cardoso, 1994; Cardoso and Comon, 1996;
Ziehe et al., 2004). Another alternative and a more stable approach compared to full
diagonalization is a Schur-like method which finds a unitary matrix U which simultaneously
triangularizes the respective matrices (Corless et al., 1997). It is an interesting open question
whether these techniques can yield similar improved learnability results and also enjoy the
attractive computational properties of the tensor power method.
