      Given a matrix M of low-rank, we consider the problem of reconstructing it from noisy observa-
      tions of a small, random subset of its entries. The problem arises in a variety of applications, from
      collaborative filtering (the ‘Netflix problem’) to structure-from-motion and positioning. We study
      a low complexity algorithm introduced by Keshavan, Montanari, and Oh (2010), based on a com-
      bination of spectral techniques and manifold optimization, that we call here O PT S PACE. We prove
      performance guarantees that are order-optimal in a number of circumstances.
      Keywords: matrix completion, low-rank matrices, spectral methods, manifold optimization
1. Introduction
Spectral techniques are an authentic workhorse in machine learning, statistics, numerical analysis,
and signal processing. Given a matrix M, its largest singular values—and the associated singular
vectors—‘explain’ the most significant correlations in the underlying data source. A low-rank ap-
proximation of M can further be used for low-complexity implementations of a number of linear
algebra algorithms (Frieze et al., 2004).
     In many practical circumstances we have access only to a sparse subset of the entries of an
m × n matrix M. It has recently been discovered that, if the matrix M has rank r, and unless it is too
‘structured’, a small random subset of its entries allow to reconstruct it exactly. This result was first
proved by Candès and Recht (2008) by analyzing a convex relaxation introduced by Fazel (2002). A
tighter analysis of the same convex relaxation was carried out by Candès and Tao (2009). A number
of iterative schemes to solve the convex optimization problem appeared soon thereafter (Cai et al.,
2008; Ma et al., 2009; Toh and Yun, 2009).
     In an alternative line of work, Keshavan, Montanari, and Oh (2010) attacked the same problem
using a combination of spectral techniques and manifold optimization: We will refer to their al-
gorithm as O PT S PACE. O PT S PACE is intrinsically of low complexity, the most complex operation
being computing r singular values (and the corresponding singular vectors) of a sparse m × n matrix.
The performance guarantees proved by Keshavan et al. (2010) are comparable with the information
theoretic lower bound: roughly nr max{r, log n} random entries are needed to reconstruct M exactly
(here we assume m of order n). A related approach was also developed by Lee and Bresler (2009),
although without performance guarantees for matrix completion.

     The above results crucially rely on the assumption that M is exactly a rank r matrix. For many
applications of interest, this assumption is unrealistic and it is therefore important to investigate
their robustness. Can the above approaches be generalized when the underlying data is ‘well ap-
proximated’ by a rank r matrix? This question was addressed by Candès and Plan (2009) within the
convex relaxation approach of Candès and Recht (2008). The present paper proves a similar robust-
ness result for O PT S PACE. Remarkably the guarantees we obtain are order-optimal in a variety of
circumstances, and improve over the analogous results of Candès and Plan (2009).
1.1 Model Definition
Let M be an m × n matrix of rank r, that is
                                           M = UΣV T .                                             (1)
where U has dimensions m × r, V has dimensions n × r, and Σ is a diagonal r × r matrix. We assume
that each entry of M is perturbed, thus producing an ‘approximately’ low-rank matrix N, with
                                          Ni j = Mi j + Zi j ,
where the matrix Z will be assumed to be ‘small’ in an appropriate sense.
     Out of the m × n entries of N, a subset E ⊆ [m] × [n] is revealed. We let N E be the m × n matrix
that contains the revealed entries of N, and is filled with 0’s in the other positions
                                          
                                              Ni j if (i, j) ∈ E ,
                                   NiEj =
                                                0 otherwise.
Analogously, we let M E and Z E be the m × n matrices that contain the entries of M and Z, re-
spectively, in the revealed positions and is filled with 0’s in the other positions. The set E will be
uniformly random given its size |E|.
1.2 Algorithm
For the reader’s convenience, we recall the algorithm introduced by Keshavan et al. (2010), which
we will analyze here. The basic idea is to minimize the cost function F(X,Y ), defined by
                                F(X,Y ) ≡         min F (X,Y, S) ,                                 (2)
                                                 S∈Rr×r
                                                 1
                                                 2 (i,∑
                             F (X,Y, S) ≡                  (Ni j − (XSY T )i j )2 .
                                                      j)∈E
Here X ∈ Rn×r , Y ∈ Rm×r are orthogonal matrices, normalized by X T X = mI, Y T Y = nI.
     Minimizing F(X,Y ) is an a priori difficult task, since F is a non-convex function. The key
insight is that the singular value decomposition (SVD) of N E provides an excellent initial guess,
and that the minimum can be found with high probability by standard gradient descent after this
initialization. Two caveats must be added to this description: (1) In general the matrix N E must be
‘trimmed’ to eliminate over-represented rows and columns; (2) For technical reasons, we consider
a slightly modified cost function to be denoted by F(X,Y e       ).

    The various steps of the above algorithm are defined as follows.
    Trimming. We say that a row is ‘over-represented’ if it contains more than 2|E|/m revealed
entries (i.e., more than twice the average number of revealed entries per row). Analogously, a
column is over-represented if it contains more than 2|E|/n revealed entries. The trimmed matrix N           eE
is obtained from N E by setting to 0 over-represented rows and columns.

where X (i) denotes the i-th row of X, and Y ( j) the j-th row of Y . The function G1 : R+ → R is such
that G1 (z) = 0 if z ≤ 1 and G1 (z) = e(z−1) − 1 otherwise. Further, we can choose ρ = Θ(|E|).
                                              2
    Let us stress that the regularization term is mainly introduced for our proof technique to work
(and a broad family of functions G1 would work as well). In numerical experiments we did not find
any performance loss in setting ρ = 0.
    One important feature of O PT S PACE is that F(X,Y ) and F(X,Y          e    ) are regarded as functions
                                         m           n
of the r-dimensional subspaces of R and R generated (respectively) by the columns of X and
Y . This interpretation is justified by the fact that F(X,Y ) = F(XA,Y B) for any two orthogonal
matrices A, B ∈ Rr×r (the same property holds for F).        e The set of r dimensional subspaces of Rm
is a differentiable Riemannian manifold G(m, r) (the Grassmann manifold). The gradient descent
algorithm is applied to the function Fe : M(m, n) ≡ G(m, r) × G(n, r) → R. For further details on
optimization by gradient descent on matrix manifolds we refer to Edelman et al. (1999) and Absil
et al. (2008).

1.3 Some Notations
The matrix M to be reconstructed takes the form (1) where U ∈ Rm×r , V ∈ Rn×r . We write U =
                                                                                                        √          √

and uTi u j = 0, vTi v j = 0 for i 6= j (there is no loss of generality in this, since normalizations can be
absorbed by redefining Σ).
      We shall write Σ = diag(Σ1 , . . . , Σr ) with Σ1 ≥ Σ2 ≥ · · · ≥ Σr > 0. The maximum and minimum
singular values will also be denoted by Σmax = Σ1 and Σmin = Σr . Further, the maximum size of an
entry of M is Mmax ≡ maxi j |Mi j |.
      Probability is taken with respect to the uniformly random subset E ⊆ [m] × [n] given |E| and
                                                                     √
(eventually) the noise matrix Z. Define ε ≡ |E|/ mn. In the case when m = n, ε corresponds to the
average number of revealed entries per row or column. Then it is convenient to work with a model
                                                                                      √
in which√each entry is revealed        √ independently            with probability ε/ mn. Since, with high probability

|E| ∈ [ε α n − A n log n, ε α n + A n log n], any guarantee on the algorithm performances that
holds within one model, holds within the other model as well if we allow for a vanishing shift in ε.
We will use C, C′ etc. to denote universal numerical constants.
      It is convenient to define the following projection operator PE (·) as the sampling operator, which
maps an m × n matrix onto an |E|-dimensional subspace in Rm×n

      Given a vector x ∈ Rn , kxk will denote its Euclidean norm. For a matrix X ∈ Rn×n , kXkF is its
Frobenius norm, and kXk2 its operator norm (i.e., kXk2 = supu6=0 kXuk/kuk). The standard scalar
product between vectors or matrices will sometimes be indicated by hx, yi or hX,Y i ≡ Tr(X T Y ),
respectively. Finally, we use the standard combinatorics notation [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n} to denote the
set of first n integers.
1.4 Main Results
Our main result is a performance guarantee for O PT S PACE under appropriate incoherence assump-
tions, and is presented in Section 1.4.2. Before presenting it, we state a theorem of independent
interest that provides an error bound on the simple trimming-plus-SVD approach. The reader inter-
ested in the O PT S PACE guarantee can go directly to Section 1.4.2.
      Throughout this paper, without loss of generality, we assume α ≡ m/n ≥ 1.
1.4.1 S IMPLE SVD
Our first result shows that, in great generality, the rank-r projection of N                  e E provides a reasonable
approximation of M. We define ZeE to be an m × n matrix obtained from Z E , after the trimming step
of the pseudocode above, that is, by setting to zero the over-represented rows and columns.
Theorem 1.1 Let N = M + Z, where M has rank r, and assume that the subset of revealed entries
E ⊆ [m] × [n] is uniformly random with size |E|. Let Mmax = max(i, j)∈[m]×[n] |Mi j |. Then there exists
numerical constants C and C′ such that

Projection onto rank-r matrices through SVD is a pretty standard tool, and is used as first analysis
method for many practical problems. At a high-level, projection onto rank-r matrices can be in-
terpreted as ‘treat missing entries as zeros’. This theorem shows that this approach is reasonably
robust if the number of observed entries is as large as the number of degrees of freedom (which is
about (m + n)r) times a large constant. The error bound is the sum of two contributions: the first
one can be interpreted as an undersampling effect (error induced by missing entries) and the second
as a noise effect. Let us stress that trimming is crucial for achieving this guarantee.
1.4.2 O PT S PACE
Theorem 1.1 helps to set the stage for the key point of this paper: a much better approximation
                                       e
is obtained by minimizing the cost F(X,Y        ) (step 3 in the pseudocode above), provided M satisfies
an appropriate incoherence condition. Let M = UΣV T be a low rank matrix, and assume, without
loss of generality, U T U = mI and V T V = nI. We say that M is (µ0 , µ1 )-incoherent if the following
conditions hold.
  A1. For all i ∈ [m], j ∈ [n] we have, ∑rk=1 Uik2 ≤ µ0 r, ∑rk=1 Vik2 ≤ µ0 r.
  A2. For all i ∈ [m], j ∈ [n] we have, | ∑rk=1 Uik (Σk /Σ1 )V jk | ≤ µ1 r1/2 .
Theorem 1.2 Let N = M + Z, where M is a (µ0 , µ1 )-incoherent matrix of rank r, and assume that
the subset of revealed entries E ⊆ [m] × [n] is uniformly random with size |E|. Further, let Σmin =
Σr ≤ · · · ≤ Σ1 = Σmax with Σmax /Σmin ≡ κ. Let M      b be the output of O PT S PACE on input N E . Then
                                            ′
there exists numerical constants C and C such that if

classes of noise on the performance of O PT S PACE.
1.5 Noise Models
In order to make sense of the above results, it is convenient to consider a couple of simple models
for the noise matrix Z:
    Independent entries model. We assume that Z’s entries are i.i.d. random variables, with zero
mean E{Zi j } = 0 and sub-Gaussian tails. The latter means that
                                                                x2

                                       P{|Zi j | ≥ x} ≤ 2 e    2σ2 ,
for some constant σ2 uniformly bounded in n.

     Worst case model. In this model Z is arbitrary, but we have an uniform bound on the size of its
entries: |Zi j | ≤ Zmax .
     The basic parameter entering our main results is the operator norm of ZeE , which is bounded as
follows in these two noise models.
Theorem 1.3 If Z is a random matrix drawn according to the independent entries model, then for
any sample size |E| there is a constant C such that,
                                                              1/2

|E| ≥ n log n (for n ≥ α), we have
                                                       1/2

     If Z is a matrix from the worst case model, then

                                                    n α
for any realization of E.
It is elementary to show that, if |E| ≥ 15αn log n, no row or column is over-represented with high
probability. It follows that in the regime of |E| for which the conditions of Theorem 1.2 are satisfied,
we have Z E = ZeE and hence the bound (5) applies to kZeE k2 as well. Then, among the other things,
this result implies that for the independent entries model the right-hand side of our error estimate,
Eq. (3), is with high probability smaller than Σmin , if |E| ≥ Crαn κ4 (σ/Σmin )2 . For the worst case
                                                         √
model, the same statement is true if Zmax ≤ Σmin /C rκ2 .
1.6 Comparison with Other Approaches to Matrix Completion
Let us begin by mentioning that a statement analogous to our preliminary Theorem 1.1 was proved
by Achlioptas and McSherry (2007). Our result however applies to any number of revealed entries,
while the one of Achlioptas and McSherry (2007) requires |E| ≥ (8 log n)4 n (which for n ≤ 5 · 108
is larger than n2 ). We refer to Section 1.8 for further discussion of this point.
     As for Theorem 1.2, we will mainly compare our algorithm with the convex relaxation approach
recently analyzed by Candès and Plan (2009), and based on semidefinite programming. Our basic
setting is indeed the same, while the algorithms are rather different.
     Figures 1 and 2 compare the average root mean square error kM               b − MkF /√mn for the two al-
gorithms as a function of |E| and the rank-r respectively. Here M is a random rank r matrix of
dimension m = n = 600, generated by letting M = U         eVe T with Uei j , Vei j i.i.d. N(0, 20/√n). The noise
is distributed according to the independent noise model with Zi j ∼ N(0, 1). In the first suite of sim-
ulations, presented in Figure 1, the rank is fixed to r = 2. In the second one (Figure 2), the number
of samples is fixed to |E| = 72000. These examples are taken from Candès and Plan (2009, Figure

tion theoretic lower bound described later in this section. After a few iterations, O PT S PACE has a
smaller root mean square error than the one produced by convex relaxation. In about 10 iterations
it becomes indistinguishable from the information theoretic lower bound for small ranks.
     In Figure 3, we illustrate the rate of convergence

error(RMSE) and fit error kPE (M − N)kF / |E|, are shown as functions of the number of iterations
in the manifold optimization step. Note, that the fit error can be easily evaluated since N E = PE (N)
is always available at the estimator. M is a random 600 × 600 rank-2 matrix generated as in the
previous examples. The additive noise is distributed as Zi j ∼ N(0, σ2 ) with σ = 0.001 (A small noise
level was used in order to trace the RMSE evolution over many iterations). Each point in the figure
is the averaged over 20 random instances, and resulting errors for two different values of sample
size |E| = 80 and |E| = 160 are shown. In both cases, we can see that the RMSE converges to the
information theoretic lower bound described later in this section. The fit error decays exponentially
with the number iterations and converges to the standard deviation of the noise which is 0.001. This
is a lower bound on the fit error when r ≪ n, since even if we have a perfect reconstruction of M,
the average fit error is still 0.001.
     For a more complete numerical comparison between various algorithms for matrix completion,
including different noise models, real data sets and ill conditioned matrices, we refer to Keshavan
and Oh (2009).
     Next, let us compare our main result with the performance guarantee of Candès and Plan (2009,
Theorem 7). Let us stress that we require the condition number κ to be bounded, while the analysis
of Candès and Plan (2009) and Candès and Tao (2009) requires a stronger incoherence assumption

(compared to our A1). Therefore the assumptions are not directly comparable. As far as the error
bound is concerned, Candès and Plan (2009) proved that the semidefinite programming approach
returns an estimate Mb which satisfies

(The constant in front of the first
but in any case larger than 4 2. We choose to quote a result which is slightly less accurate but
easier to parse.)
    Theorem 1.2 improves over this result in several respects: (1) We do not have the second term on
the right-hand side of (6), that actually increases with the number of observed entries; (2) Our error
decreases as n/|E| rather than (n/|E|)1/2 ; (3) The noise enters Theorem 1.2 through the operator
norm kZ E k2 instead of its Frobenius norm kZ E kF ≥ kZ E k2 . For E uniformly random, one expects
kZ E kF to be roughly of order kZ p E k √n. For instance, within the independent entries model with
                                       2                                p
bounded variance σ, kZ E kF = Θ( |E|) while kZ E k2 is of order |E|/n (up to logarithmic terms).
    Theorem 1.2 can also be compared to an information theoretic lower bound computed by Candès
and Plan (2009). Suppose, for simplicity, m = n and assume that an oracle provides us a linear
subspace T where the correct rank r matrix M = UΣV T lies. More precisely, we know that M ∈ T
where T is a linear space of dimension 2nr − r2 defined by
                           T = {UY T + XV T | X ∈ Rn×r ,Y ∈ Rn×r } .
Notice that the rank constraint is therefore replaced by this simple linear constraint. The minimum
mean square error estimator is computed by projecting the revealed entries onto the subspace T ,
which can be done by solving a least squares problem. Candès and Plan (2009) analyzed the root
mean squared error of the resulting estimator M   b and showed that
                                                         s

    For the sake of comparison, suppose we have i.i.d. Gaussian noise with variance σ2 . In this case
the oracle estimator yields (for r = o(n))

The bound (6) on the semidefinite programming approach yields
                                                       p                  

Finally, using Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 we deduce that O PT S PACE achieves
                                                                s

Hence, when the noise is i.i.d. Gaussian with small enough σ, O PT S PACE is order-optimal.

1.7 Related Work on Gradient Descent
Local optimization techniques such as gradient descent of coordinate descent have been intensively
studied in machine learning, with a number of applications. Here we will briefly review the recent
literature on the use of such techniques within collaborative filtering applications.
     Collaborative filtering was studied from a graphical models perspective in Salakhutdinov et al.
(2007), which introduced an approach to prediction based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM).
Exact learning of the model parameters is intractable for such models, but the authors studied the
performances of a contrastive divergence, which computes an approximate gradient of the likeli-
hood function, and uses it to optimize the likelihood locally. Based on empirical evidence, it was
argued that RBM’s have several advantages over spectral methods for collaborative filtering.
     An objective function analogous to the one used in the present paper was considered early on
in Srebro and Jaakkola (2003), which uses gradient descent in the factors to minimize a weighted
sum of square residuals. Salakhutdinov and Mnih (2008) justified the use of such an objective
function by deriving it as the (negative) log-posterior of an appropriate probabilistic model. This
approach naturally lead to the use of quadratic regularization in the factors. Again, gradient descent
in the factors was used to perform the optimization. Also, this paper introduced a logistic mapping
between the low-rank matrix and the recorded ratings.
     Recently, this line of work was pushed further in Salakhutdinov and Srebro (2010), which em-
phasize the advantage of using a non-uniform quadratic regularization in the factors. The basic
objective function was again a sum of square residuals, and version of stochastic gradient descent
was used to optimize it.
     This rich and successful line of work emphasizes the importance of obtaining a rigorous under-
standing of methods based on local minimization of the sum of square residuals with respect to the
factors. The present paper provides a first step in that direction. Hopefully the techniques developed
here will be useful to analyze the many variants of this approach.
     The relationship between the non-convex objective function and convex relaxation introduced
by Fazel (2002) was further investigated by Srebro et al. (2005) and Recht et al. (2007). The basic
relation is provided by the identity
                                         1         
                               kMk∗ =        min kXk2F + kY k2F ,                                     (7)
                                         2 M=XY T
where kMk∗ denotes the nuclear norm of M (the sum of its singular values). In other words, adding a
regularization term that is quadratic in the factors (as the one used in much of the literature reviewed
above) is equivalent to weighting M by its nuclear norm, that can be regarded as a convex surrogate
of its rank.
     In view of the identity (7) it might be possible to use the results in this paper to prove stronger
guarantees on the nuclear norm minimization approach. Unfortunately this implication is not im-
mediate. Indeed in the present paper we assume the correct rank r is known, while on the other
hand we do not use a quadratic regularization in the factors. (See Keshavan and Oh, 2009 for a
procedure that estimates the rank from the data and is provably successful under the hypotheses of
Theorem 1.2.) Trying to establish such an implication, and clarifying the relation between the two
approaches is nevertheless a promising research direction.

1.8 On the Spectrum of Sparse Matrices and the Role of Trimming
The trimming step of the O PT S PACE algorithm is somewhat counter-intuitive in that we seem to be
wasting information. In this section we want to clarify its role through a simple example. Before
describing the example, let us stress once again two facts: (i) In the last step of our the algorithm,
the trimmed entries are actually incorporated in the cost function and hence the full information
is exploited; (ii) Trimming is not the only way to treat over-represented rows/columns in M E , and
probably not the optimal one. One might for instance rescale the entries of such rows/columns. We
stick to trimming because we can prove it actually works.
    Let us now turn to the example. Assume, for the sake of simplicity, that m = n, there is no
noise in the revealed entries, and M is the rank one matrix with Mi j = 1 for all i and j. Within
the independent sampling model, the matrix M E has i.i.d. entries, with distribution Bernoulli(ε/n).
The number of non-zero entries in a column is Binomial(n, ε/n) and is independent for different
columns. It is not hard to realize that the column with the largest number of entries has more than
C log n/ log log n entries, with positive probability (this probability can be made as large as we want
by reducing C). Let i be the index of this column, and consider the test vector e(i) that has the i-th
entry equal to 1 and all the othersp equal to 0. By computing kM E e(i) k, we conclude that the largest
singular value of M E is at least C log n/ log log n. In particular, this is very different from the
largest singular value of E{M E } = (ε/n)M which is ε. This suggests that approximating M with
the Pr (M E ) leads to a large error. Hence trimming is crucial in proving Theorem 1.1. Also, the
phenomenon is more severe in real data sets than in the present model, where each entry is revealed
independently.
    Trimming is also crucial in proving Theorem 1.3. Using the above argument, it is possible to
show that under the worst case model,
                                                        s
                                                            log n
                                  kZ E k2 ≥ C′ (ε) Zmax             .
                                                          log log n
This suggests that the largest singular value of the noise matrix Z E is quite different from the largest
singular value of E{Z E } which is εZmax .
    To summarize, Theorems 1.1 and 1.3 (for the worst case model) simply do not hold without
trimming or a similar procedure to normalize rows/columns of N E . Trimming allows to overcome
the above phenomenon by setting to 0 over-represented rows/columns.
2. Proof of Theorem 1.1
As explained in the introduction, the crucial idea is to consider the singular value decomposition
of the trimmed matrix N   e E instead of the original matrix N E . Apart from a trivial rescaling, these
singular values are close to the ones of the original matrix M.

(the point corresponding to the matrix M to be reconstructed). Throughout the proof we let K (µ)
be the set of matrix couples (X,Y ) ∈ Rm×r × Rn×r such that kX (i) k2 ≤ µr, kY ( j) k2 ≤ µr for all i, j.

    We can now turn to the proof of our main theorem.
Proof (Theorem 1.2). Let δ = Σmin /C0 Σmax with C0 large enough so that the hypotheses of Lemmas
4 and 5 are verified.
    Call {xk }k≥0 the sequence of pairs (Xk ,Yk ) ∈ M(m, n) generated by gradient descent. By as-
sumption the right-hand side of Eq. (3) is smaller than Σmin . The following is therefore true for
some numerical constant C:

Notice that the constant appearing here can be made as large as we want by modifying the constant
appearing in the statement of the theorem. Further, by using Corollary 3.1 in Eqs. (8) and (9) we get

By Eq. (13), with large enough C, we can assume δ0,− ≤ δ/20 and δ0,+ ≤ (δ/20)(Σmin /Σmax ).

    Next, we provide a bound on d(u, x0 ). Using Remark 3, we have d(u, x0 ) ≤ (π/n αΣmin )kM −
X0 S0Y0T kF . Together with Theorem 1.1 this implies

Since ε ≥ C′′ αµ21 r2 (Σmax /Σmin )4 as per our assumptions and Mmax ≤ µ1 rΣmax for incoherent M,
the first term in the above bound is upper bounded by Σmin /20C0 Σmax , for large enough C′′ . Using
Eq. (13), with large enough constant C, the second term in the above bound is upper bounded by
Σmin /20C0 Σmax . Hence we get

   1. xk ∈ K (4µ0 ) for all k.
       First we notice that we can assume x0 ∈ K (3µ0 ). Indeed, if this does not hold, we can
       ‘rescale’ those rows of X0 , Y0 that violate the constraint. A proof that this rescaling is possible
       was given in Keshavan et al. (2010) (cf. Remark 6.2 there). We restate the result here for the
       reader’s convenience in the next Remark.
       Remark 6 Let U, X ∈ Rn×r with U T U = X T X = nI and U ∈ K (µ0 ) and d(X,U) ≤ δ ≤ 16              1

       Then there exists X ∈ R′    n×r             ′T  ′        ′                     ′

       such an X ′ can be computed from X in a time of O(nr2 ).

       (C1 Σ2min /C2 Σ2max )(δ/20)2 . Also assuming Eq. (13) with large enough C, we have δ0,− ≤ δ/20
       and δ0,+ ≤ (δ/20)(Σmin /Σmax ). Then, by Eq. (15),
                                                            √        2δ2

       Also, using Eq. (14), for all xk such that d(xk , u) ∈ [δ/10, δ], we have

       Hence, for all xk such that d(xk , u) ∈ [δ/10, δ], we have F(x)

4. Proof of Theorem 1.3
Proof (Independent entries model ) We start with a claim that for any sampling set E, we have
                                               kZeE k2 ≤ kZ E k2 .
To prove this claim, let x∗ and y∗ be m and n dimensional vectors, respectively, achieving the opti-
mum in maxkxk≤1,kyk≤1 {xT ZeE y}, that is, such that kZeE k2 = x∗T ZeE y∗ . Recall that, as a result of the
trimming step, all the entries in trimmed rows and columns of ZeE are set to zero. Then, there is no
gain in maximizing xT ZeE y to have a non-zero entry xi∗ for i corresponding to the rows which are
trimmed. Analogously, for j corresponding to the trimmed columns, we can assume without loss of
generality that y∗j = 0. From this observation, it follows that x∗T ZeE y∗ = x∗T Z E y∗ , since the trimmed
matrix ZeE and the sample noise matrix Z E only differ in the trimmed rows and columns. The claim
follows from the fact that x∗T Z E y∗ ≤ kZ E k2 , for any x∗ and y∗ with unit norm.
    In what follows, we will first prove that kZ E k2 is bounded by the right-hand side of Eq. (4)
    any√range of |E|. Due to the                                                 eE
for p                                √ above observation, this implies that kZ k2 is also bounded by
Cσ ε α log n, where ε ≡ |E|/ αn. Further, we use the same analysis to prove a tighter bound in
Eq. (5) when |E| ≥ n log n.                                        p √
    First, we want to show that kZ E k2 is bounded by Cσ ε α log n, and Zi j ’s are i.i.d. random
   E with zero mean and sub-Gaussian tail with parameter σ . The proof strategy is to show that

E kZ k2 is bounded, using the result of Seginer (2000) on expected norm of random matrices, and
use the fact that k · k2 is a Lipschitz continuous function of its arguments together with concentration
inequality for Lipschitz functions on i.i.d. Gaussian random variables due to Talagrand (1996).
    Note that k · k2 is a Lipschitz function with a Lipschitz constant 1. Indeed, for any M and M ′ ,
 kM ′ k2 − kMk2 ≤ kM ′ − Mk2 ≤ kM ′ − MkF , where the first inequality follows from triangular
inequality and the second inequality follows from the fact that k · k2F is the sum of the squared
singular values.

where the first inequality follows from the definition of Zk j as a zero mean random variable with
sub-Gaussian tail, and the second inequality follows from log(1 + x) ≤ x. By applying Chernoff
bound, Eq. (28) follows. Note that an analogous result holds for the Euclidean norm on the rows
kZi•E k2 .
                                                                                    
     Substituting Eq. (28) and P max j kZ•Ej k2 ≥ z ≤ m P kZ•Ej k2 ≥ z in Eq. (27), we get
                                                        √       8σ2 m − 3 (β−3)ε√α
                                E max kZ•Ej k2 ≤ βσ2 ε α +               e 8             .                            (29)

The second term can            be made arbitrarily small by taking β = C log n with large enough C. Since
                     q                    
E max j kZ• j k ≤ E max j kZ•Ej k2 , applying Eq. (29) with β = C log n in Eq. (26) gives
                E
                                                           q √
                                         E kZ E k2 ≤ Cσ ε α log n .
Together with Eq. (25), this proves the desired thesis for any sample size |E|.
     In the case when |E| ≥ n log n, we can get a tighter bound by similar analysis. Since ε ≥ C′ log n,
for some constant C′ , the second term in Eq. (29) can be made arbitrarily small with a large constant
β. Hence, applying Eq. (29) with β = C in Eq. (26), we get
                                                             q

                                            E kZ E k2 ≤ Cσ ε α .
Together with Eq. (25), this proves the desired thesis for |E| ≥ n log n.
Proof (Worst Case Model ) Let D be the m× n all-ones matrix. Then for any matrix Z from the worst
case model, we have kZeE k2 ≤ Zmax kD          e E k2 , since xT ZeE y ≤ ∑i, j Zmax |xi |D
                                                                                         e Eij |y j |, which follows from
the fact that Zi j ’s are uniformly bounded. Further, D           e E is an adjacency matrix of a corresponding
bipartite graph with bounded degrees. Then, for any choice of E the following is true for all positive
integers k:
                                                                                   
                    kDe E k2k            T eE T eE k                    eE T eE k
                           2 ≤ max x ((D ) D ) x ≤ Tr ((D ) D ) ≤ n(2ε) .
                                                                                                     2k
                                 x,kxk=1
                               
Now Tr ((D              e E ) is the number of paths of length 2k on the bipartite graph with adjacency
                 e E )T D    k
matrix D   e E , that begin and end at i for every i ∈ [n]. Since this graph has degree bounded by 2ε, we
get
                                                 e E k2k
                                                kD     2 ≤ n(2ε) .
                                                                   2k
Taking k large, we get the desired thesis.
