The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)
previously developed guidance for the interpretation of sequence
variants.1
In the past decade, sequencing technology has evolved
­
rapidly with the advent of high-throughput next-generation
­
sequencing. By adopting and leveraging next-generation sequencing,
clinical laboratories are now performing an ever-increasing catalogue of
genetic testing spanning genotyping, single genes, gene panels, exomes,
genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenetic assays for genetic disorders.
By virtue of increased complexity, this shift in genetic testing has been
accompanied by new challenges in sequence interpretation. In this
context the ACMG convened a workgroup in 2013 comprising repre-
sentatives from the ACMG, the Association for Molecular Pathology
(AMP), and the College of American Pathologists to revisit and revise
the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants.
The group consisted of clinical laboratory directors and clinicians. This
report represents expert opinion of the workgroup with input from
ACMG, AMP, and College of American Pathologists stakeholders.
These recommendations primarily apply to the breadth of genetic tests
used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, ­
panels,
exomes, and genomes. This report recommends the use of specific stan-
dard terminology—“pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain sig-
nificance,” “likely benign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified
in genes that cause Mendelian disorders. Moreover, this recommenda-
tion describes a process for classifying variants into these five categories
based on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g., population
data, computational data, functional data, segregation data). Because
of the increased complexity of analysis and interpretation of clinical
genetic testing described in this report, the ACMG strongly recom-
mends that clinical molecular genetic testing should be performed in a
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–approved laboratory,
with results interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist
or molecular genetic pathologist or the equivalent.

RICHARDS et al | Interpretation of sequence variants
ACMG Standards and Guidelines
INTRODUCTION
Clinical molecular laboratories are increasingly detecting novel
sequence variants in the course of testing patient specimens for
a rapidly increasing number of genes associated with genetic
disorders. While some phenotypes are associated with a single
gene, many are associated with multiple genes. Our understand-
ing of the clinical significance of any given sequence variant
falls along a gradient, ranging from those in which the variant
is almost certainly pathogenic for a disorder to those that are
almost certainly benign. While the previous American College
of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommendations
provided interpretative categories of sequence variants and an
algorithm for interpretation, the recommendations did not pro-
vide defined terms or detailed variant classification guidance.1
This report describes updated standards and guidelines for the
classification of sequence variants using criteria informed by
expert opinion and empirical data.
METHODS
In 2013 a workgroup consisting of ACMG, Association
for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and College of American
Pathologists members, representing clinical laboratory direc-
tors and clinicians, was formed with the goal of developing a
recommendation for the use of standard terminology for clas-
sifying sequence variants using available evidence weighted
according to a system developed through expert opinion, work-
group consensus, and community input. To assess the views of
the clinical laboratory community, surveys were sent to over
100 sequencing laboratories in the United States and Canada
that were listed in GeneTests.org, requesting input on termi-
nology preferences and evaluation of evidence for classifying
variants. Laboratory testing experience included rare disease as
well as pharmacogenomics and somatic cancer testing. The first
survey, aimed at assessing terminology preferences, was sent in
February 2013, and the results were presented in an open forum
at the 2013 ACMG annual meeting including over 75 attendees.
Survey respondents represented more than 45 laboratories in
North America. The outcome of the survey and open forum
indicated that (i) a five-tier terminology system using the terms
“pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,”
“likely benign,” and “benign” was preferred and already in use
by a majority of laboratories, and (ii) the first effort of the work-
group should focus on Mendelian and mitochondrial variants.
In the first survey, laboratories also were asked to provide
their protocols for variant assessment, and 11 shared their
methods. By analyzing all the protocols submitted, the work-
group developed a set of criteria to weight variant evidence
and a set of rules for combining criteria to arrive at one of the
five classification tiers. Workgroup members tested the scheme
within their laboratories for several weeks using variants
already classified in their laboratories and/or by the broader
community. In addition, typical examples of variants harbor-
ing the most common types of evidence were tested for clas-
sification assignment to ensure the system would classify those
variants according to current approaches consistently applied
by workgroup members. A second survey was sent in August
2013 to the same laboratories identified through GeneTests.
org as well as through AMP’s listserv of ~2,000 members, along
with the proposed classification scheme and a detailed supple-
ment describing how to use each of the criteria. Laboratories
were asked to use the scheme and to provide feedback as to the
suitability and relative weighting of each criteria, the ease of use
of the classification system, and whether they would adopt such
a system in their own laboratory. Responses from over 33 labo-
ratories indicated majority support for the proposed approach,
and feedback further guided the development of the proposed
standards and guidelines.
In November 2013 the workgroup held a workshop at the
AMP meeting with more than 50 attendees, presenting the
revised classification criteria and two potential scoring systems.
One system is consistent with the approach presented here and
the other is a point system whereby each criterion is given a
number of points, assigning positive points for pathogenic
criteria and negative points for benign criteria, with the total
defining the variant class. With an audience-response system,
the participants were asked how they would weight each cri-
terion (as strong, moderate or supporting, or not used) dur-
ing evaluation of variant evidence. Again, the responses were
incorporated into the classification system presented here. It
should be noted that while the majority of respondents did
favor a point system, the workgroup felt that the assignment of
specific points for each criterion implied a quantitative level of
understanding of each criterion that is currently not supported
scientifically and does not take into account the complexity of
interpreting genetic evidence.
The workgroup also evaluated the literature for recommen-
dations from other professional societies and working groups
that have developed variant classification guidelines for well-
studied genes in breast cancer, colon cancer, and cystic fibro-
sis and statistical analysis programs for quantitative evaluation
of variants in select diseases.2–5
While those variant analysis
guidelines are useful in a specific setting, it was difficult to apply
their proposed criteria to all genes and in different laboratory
settings. The variant classification approach described in this
article is meant to be applicable to variants in all Mendelian
genes, whether identified by single gene tests, multigene ­
panels,
exome sequencing, or genome sequencing. We expect that this
variant classification approach will evolve as technology and
knowledge improve. We should also note that those working
in specific disease groups should continue to develop more
focused guidance regarding the classification of variants in spe-
cific genes given that the applicability and weight assigned to
certain criteria may vary by gene and disease.
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
Terminology
A mutation is defined as a permanent change in the nucleo-
tide sequence, whereas a polymorphism is defined as a vari-
ant with a frequency above 1%. The terms “mutation” and
­
“polymorphism,” however, which have been used widely,
Volume 17 | Number 5 | May 2015 | Genetics in medicine
407
Interpretation of sequence variants | RICHARDS et al ACMG Standards and Guidelines
often lead to confusion because of incorrect assumptions of
pathogenic and benign effects, respectively. Thus, it is recom-
mended that both terms be replaced by the term “variant” with
the following modifiers: (i) pathogenic, (ii) likely pathogenic,
(iii) uncertain significance, (iv) likely benign, or (v) benign.
Although these modifiers may not address all human phe-
notypes, they comprise a five-tier system of classification for
variants relevant to Mendelian disease as addressed in this
guidance. It is recommended that all assertions of pathogenic-
ity (including “likely pathogenic”) be reported with respect to
a condition and inheritance pattern (e.g., c.1521_1523delCTT
(p.Phe508del), pathogenic, cystic fibrosis, autosomal recessive).
It should be noted that some laboratories may choose to have
additional tiers (e.g., subclassification of variants of uncertain
significance, particularly for internal use), and this practice is
not considered inconsistent with these recommendations. It
should also be noted that the terms recommended here differ
somewhat from the current recommendations for classifying
copy-number variants detected by cytogenetic microarray.6
The schema recommended for copy-number variants, while
also including five tiers, uses “uncertain clinical significance—
likely pathogenic” and “uncertain clinical significance—likely
benign.” The majority of the workgroup was not supportive
of using “uncertain significance” to modify the terms “likely
pathogenic” or “likely benign” given that it was felt that the
criteria presented here to classify variants into the “likely”
categories included stronger evidence than outlined in the
copy-number variant guideline and that combining these two
categories would create confusion for the health-care provid-
ers and individuals receiving clinical reports. However, it was
felt that the use of the term “likely” should be restricted to
variants where the data support a high likelihood that it is
pathogenic or a high likelihood that it is benign. Although
there is no quantitative definition of the term “likely,” guid-
ance has been proposed in certain variant classification set-
tings. A survey of the community during an ACMG open
forum, however, suggested a much wider range of uses of the
term “likely.” Recognizing this, we propose that the terms
“likely pathogenic” and “likely benign” be used to mean
greater than 90% certainty of a variant either being disease-
causing or benign to provide laboratories with a common,
albeit arbitrary, definition. Similarly, the International Agency
for Research on Cancer guideline2
supports a 95% level of
certainty of pathogenicity, but the workgroup (confirmed by
feedback during the ACMG open forum) felt that clinicians
and patients were willing to tolerate a slightly higher chance of
error, leading to the 90% decision. It should also be noted that
at present most variants do not have data to support a quan-
titative assignment of variant certainty to any of the five cat-
egories given the heterogeneous nature of most diseases. It is
hoped that over time experimental and statistical approaches
to objectively assign pathogenicity confidence to variants will
be developed and that more rigorous approaches to defining
what the clinical community desires in terms of confidence
will more fully inform terminologies and likelihoods.
The use of new terminologies may require education of the
community. Professional societies are encouraged to engage in
educating all laboratories as well as health-care providers on
the use of these terms, and laboratories also are encouraged to
directly educate their ordering physicians.
Nomenclature
A uniform nomenclature, informed by a set of standardized cri-
teria, is recommended to ensure the unambiguous designation
of a variant and enable effective sharing and downstream use
of genomic information. A standard gene variant nomenclature
(http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen) is maintained and versioned
by the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS),7
and its use
is recommended as the primary guideline for determining vari-
ant nomenclature except as noted.6
Laboratories should note
the version being used in their test methods. Tools are avail-
able to provide correct HGVS nomenclature for describing
variants (https://mutalyzer.nl).8
Clinical reports should include
sequence reference(s) to ensure unambiguous naming of the
variant at the DNA level, as well as to provide coding and pro-
tein nomenclature to assist in functional interpretations (e.g.,
“g.” for genomic sequence, “c.” for coding DNA sequence, “p.”
for protein, “m.” for mitochondria). The coding nomenclature
should be described using the “A” of the ATG translation ini-
tiation codon as position number 1. Where historical alternate
nomenclature has been used, current nomenclature should be
used with an additional notation of the historical naming. The
reference sequence should be complete and derived from either
the National Center for Biotechnology Information RefSeq
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/)9
with the ver-
sion number or the Locus Reference Genomic database (http://
www.lrg-sequence.org).10
Genomic coordinates should be used
and defined according to a standard genome build (e.g., hg19)
or a genomic reference sequence that covers the entire gene
(including the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions and promoter).
A reference transcript for each gene should be used and pro-
vided in the report when describing coding variants. The tran-
script should represent either the longest known transcript
and/or the most clinically relevant transcript. Community-
supported reference transcripts can often be identified through
Locus Reference Genomic,10
the Consensus CDS Database,11
the Human Gene Mutation Database (http://www.hgmd.
cf.ac.uk), ClinVar (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar), or a
locus-specific database. However, laboratories should evaluate
the impact of the variant on all clinically relevant transcripts,
including alternate transcripts that contain additional exons or
extended untranslated regions, when there are known variants
in these regions that are clinically interpretable.
Not all types of variants (e.g., complex variants) are covered
by the HGVS recommendations, but possible descriptions
for complex variants have been reported.7,12
In addition, this
ACMG recommendation supports three specific exceptions
to the HGVS nomenclature rules: (i) “X” is still considered
acceptable for use in reporting nonsense variants in addition
to the current HGVS recommendation of “*” and “Ter”; (ii) it is
Genetics in medicine | Volume 17 | Number 5 | May 2015

RICHARDS et al | Interpretation of sequence variants
ACMG Standards and Guidelines
­recommended that exons be numbered according to the chosen
reference transcript used to designate the variant; and (iii) the
term “pathogenic” is recommended instead of “affects function”
because clinical interpretation is typically directly evaluating
pathogenicity.
Literature and database use
A large number of databases contain a growing number of
variants that are continuously being discovered in the human
genome. When classifying and reporting a variant, clinical lab-
oratories may find valuable information in databases, as well as
in the published literature. As noted above, sequence databases
can also be used to identify appropriate reference sequences.
Databases can be useful for gathering information but should
be used with caution.
Population databases (Table 1) are useful in obtaining
the frequencies of variants in large populations. Population
databases cannot be assumed to include only healthy indi-
viduals and are known to contain pathogenic variants. These
population databases do not contain extensive informa-
tion regarding the functional effect of these variants or any
possible associated phenotypes. When using population
databases, one must determine whether healthy or disease
cohorts were used and, if possible, whether more than one
individual in a family was included, as well as the age range
of the subjects.
Disease databases (Table 1) primarily contain variants
found in patients with disease and assessment of the variants’
pathogenicity. Disease and gene-specific databases often con-
tain variants that are incorrectly classified, including incorrect

Interpretation of sequence variants | RICHARDS et al ACMG Standards and Guidelines
claims published in the peer-reviewed literature, because many
databases do not perform a primary review of evidence. When
using disease databases, it is important to consider how patients
were ascertained, as described below.
When using databases, clinical laboratories should (i)
determine how frequently the database is updated, whether
data curation is supported, and what methods were used for
­
curation; (ii) confirm the use of HGVS nomenclature and
determine the genome build and transcript references used
for naming variants; (iii) determine the degree to which data
are validated for analytical accuracy (e.g., low-pass next-
generation sequencing versus Sanger-validated variants) and
evaluate any quality metrics that are provided to assess data
accuracy, which may require reading associated publications;
and (iv) determine the source and independence of the obser-
vations listed.
Variant assessment also includes searching the scientific
and medical literature. Literature using older nomenclature
and classification or based on a single observation should be
used with caution. When identifying individuals and families
with a variant, along with associated phenotypes, it is important
to consider how patients were ascertained. This caveat is impor-
tant when assessing data from publications because affected
individuals and related individuals are often reported multiple
times, depending on the context and size of the study. This may
be due to authorship overlap, interlaboratory collaborations, or
a proband and family members being followed across different
clinical systems. This may mistakenly lead to duplicate count-
ing of affected patients and a false increase in variant frequency.
Overlapping authorship or institutions is the first clue to the
potential for overlapping data sets.
Clinical laboratories should implement an internal system
to track all sequence variants identified in each gene and clini-
cal assertions when reported. This is important for tracking
genotype–phenotype correlations and the frequency of vari-
ants in affected and normal populations. Clinical laboratories
are encouraged to contribute to variant databases, such as
ClinVar, including clinical assertions and evidence used for
the variant classification, to aid in the continued understand-
ing of the impact of human variation. Whenever possible,
clinical information should be provided following Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations for
privacy. Clinical laboratories are encouraged to form collabo-
rations with clinicians to provide clinical information to bet-
ter understand how genotype influences clinical phenotype
and to resolve ­
differences in variant interpretation between
laboratories. Because of the great potential to aid clinical
laboratory practice, efforts are underway for clinical variant
databases to be expanded and standardized. Standardization
will provide easier access to updated information as well as
facilitate submission from the clinical laboratory. For exam-
ple, the ClinVar database allows for the deposition of variants
with clinical observations and assertions, with review status
tracked to enable a more transparent view of the levels of
quality of the curation.
Computational (in silico) predictive programs
A variety of in silico tools, both publicly and commercially
available, can aid in the interpretation of sequence variants.
The algorithms used by each tool may differ but can include
determination of the effect of the sequence variant at the
nucleotide and amino acid level, including determination of
the effect of the variant on the primary and alternative gene
transcripts, other genomic elements, as well as the potential
impact of the variant on the protein. The two main categories
of such tools include those that predict whether a missense
change is damaging to the resultant protein function or struc-
ture and those that predict whether there is an effect on splic-
ing (Table 2). Newer tools are beginning to address additional
noncoding sequences.13
The impact of a missense change depends on criteria
such as the evolutionary conservation of an amino acid
or nucleotide, the location and context within the protein
sequence, and the biochemical consequence of the amino
acid substitution. The measurement of one or a combination
of these criteria is used in various in silico algorithms that
assess the predicted impact of a missense change. Several
efforts have evaluated the performance of available predic-
tion software to compare them with each other and to assess
their ability to predict “known” disease-causing variants.14–17
In general, most algorithms for missense variant prediction
are 65–80% accurate when examining known disease vari-
ants.16
Most tools also tend to have low specificity, result-
ing in overprediction of missense changes as deleterious,
and are not as reliable at predicting missense variants with
a milder effect.18
The in silico tools more commonly used
for missense variant interpretation in clinical laboratories
include PolyPhen2,19
SIFT,20
and MutationTaster.21
A list of
in silico tools used to predict missense variants can be found
in Table 2.
Multiple software programs have been developed to predict
splicing as it relates to the creation or loss of splice sites at
the exonic or intronic level.22
In general, splice site prediction
tools have higher sensitivity (~90–100%) relative to specificity
(~60–80%) in predicting splice site abnormalities.23,24
Some of
the in silico tools commonly used for splice site variant inter-
pretation are listed in Table 2.
While many of the different software programs use different
algorithms for their predictions, they have similarities in their
underlying basis; therefore, predictions combined from differ-
ent in silico tools are considered as a single piece of evidence
in sequence interpretation as opposed to independent pieces of
evidence. The use of multiple software programs for sequence
variant interpretation is also recommended because the differ-
ent programs each have their own strengths and weaknesses,
depending on the algorithm; in many cases performance can
vary by the gene and protein sequence. These are only predic-
tions, however, and their use in sequence variant interpreta-
tion should be implemented carefully. It is not recommended
that these predictions be used as the sole source of evidence to
make a clinical assertion.

PROPOSED CRITERIA FOR INTERPRETATION OF
SEQUENCE VARIANTS
The following approach to evaluating evidence for a variant
is intended for interpretation of variants observed in patients
with suspected inherited (primarily Mendelian) disorders in a
clinical diagnostic laboratory setting. It is not intended for the
interpretation of somatic variation, pharmacogenomic (PGx)
variants, or variants in genes associated with multigenic non-
Mendelian complex disorders. Care must be taken when
applying these rules to candidate genes (“genes of uncertain
significance” (GUS)) in the context of exome or genome stud-
ies (see Special Considerations below) because this guidance
is not intended to fulfill the needs of the research community
in its effort to identify new genes in disease.
Although these approaches can be used for evaluating vari-
ants found in healthy individuals or secondary to the indication
for testing, further caution must be used, as noted in several
parts of the guideline, given the low prior likelihood that most

Interpretation of sequence variants | RICHARDS et al ACMG Standards and Guidelines
variants unrelated to the indication are pathogenic. Although
we expect that, in general, these guidelines will apply for variant
classification regardless of whether the variant was identified
through analysis of a single gene, gene panel, exome, genome,
or transcriptome, it is important to consider the differences
between implicating a variant as pathogenic (i.e., causative) for
a disease and a variant that may be predicted to be disruptive/
damaging to the protein for which it codes, but is not necessarily
implicated in a disease. These rules are intended to determine
whether a variant in a gene with a definitive role in a Mendelian
disorder may be pathogenic for that disorder. Pathogenicity
determination should be independent of interpreting the cause
of disease in a given patient. For example, a variant should not
be reported as pathogenic in one case and not pathogenic in
another simply because the variant is not thought to explain
disease in a given case. Pathogenicity should be determined
by the entire body of evidence in aggregate, including all cases
studied, arriving at a single conclusion.
This classification approach may be somewhat more strin-
gent than laboratories have applied to date. They may result
in a larger proportion of variants being categorized as uncer-
tain significance. It is hoped that this approach will reduce the
substantial number of variants being reported as “causative”
of disease without having sufficient supporting evidence for
that classification. It is important to keep in mind that when a
clinical laboratory reports a variant as pathogenic, health-care
providers are highly likely to take that as “actionable” and to
alter the treatment or surveillance of a patient25
or remove such
management in a genotype-negative family member, based on
that determination (see How Should Health-Care Providers
Use These Guidelines and Recommendations, below).
We have provided two sets of criteria: one for classification of
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (Table 3) and one for
classification of benign or likely benign variants (Table 4). Each
pathogenic criterion is weighted as very strong (PVS1), strong
(PS1–4); moderate (PM1–6), or supporting (PP1–5), and each
benign criterion is weighted as stand-alone (BA1), strong (BS1–
4), or supporting (BP1–6). The numbering within each category
does not convey any differences of weight and is merely labeled
to help refer to the different criteria. For a given variant, the
user selects the criteria based on the evidence observed for the
variant. The criteria then are combined according to the scor-
ing rules in Table 5 to choose a classification from the five-tier
system. The rules apply to all available data on a variant, whether
gathered from the current case under investigation or from
well-vetted previously published data. Unpublished case data
may also be obtained through public resources (e.g., ClinVar or
locus specific databases) and from a laboratory’s own database.
To provide critical flexibility to variant classification, some cri-
teria listed as one weight can be moved to another weight using
professional judgment, depending on the evidence collected.
For example, rule PM3 could be upgraded to strong if there
were multiple observations of detection of the variant in trans
(on opposite chromosomes) with other pathogenic variants (see
PM3 BP2 cis/trans Testing for further guidance). By contrast,
in situations when the data are not as strong as described, judg-
ment can be used to consider the evidence as fulfilling a lower
level (e.g., see PS4, Note 2 in Table 3). If a variant does not fulfill
criteria using either of these sets (pathogenic or benign), or the
evidence for benign and pathogenic is conflicting, the variant
defaults to uncertain significance. The criteria, organized by type
and strength, is shown in Figure 1. Please note that expert judg-
ment must be applied when evaluating the full body of evidence
to account for differences in the strength of variant evidence.
The following is provided to more thoroughly explain certain
concepts noted in the criteria for variant classification (Tables 3
and 4) and to provide examples and/or caveats or pitfalls in their
use. This section should be read in concert with Tables 3 and 4.
PVS1 null variants
Certain types of variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift, canonical
±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single exon or multiexon
deletion) can often be assumed to disrupt gene function by lead-
ing to a complete absence of the gene product by lack of tran-
scription or nonsense-mediated decay of an altered transcript.
One must, however, exercise caution when classifying these
variants as pathogenic by considering the following principles:
(i) When classifying such variants as pathogenic, one must
ensure that null variants are a known mechanism of
pathogenicity consistent with the established inheritance
pattern for the disease. For example, there are genes for
which only heterozygous missense variants cause disease
and null variants are benign in a heterozygous state (e.g.,
many hypertrophic cardiomyopathy genes). A novel het-
erozygous nonsense variant in the MYH7 gene would
not be considered pathogenic for dominant hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy based solely on this evidence, whereas a
novel heterozygous nonsense variant in the CFTR gene
would likely be considered a recessive pathogenic variant.
(ii) One must also be cautious when interpreting truncating
variants downstream of the most 3′ truncating variant
established as pathogenic in the literature. This is espe-
cially true if the predicted stop codon occurs in the last
exon or in the last 50 base pairs of the penultimate exon,
such that nonsense-mediated decay26
would not be pre-
dicted, and there is a higher likelihood of an expressed
protein. The length of the predicted truncated protein
would also factor into the pathogenicity assignment,
however, and such variants cannot be interpreted with-
out a functional assay.
(iii) For splice-site variants, the variant may lead to exon
skipping, shortening, or inclusion of intronic mate-
rial as a result of alternative donor/acceptor site usage
or creation of new sites. Although splice-site variants
are predicted to lead to a null effect, confirmation of
impact requires functional analysis by either RNA or
protein analysis. One must also consider the possibility
of an in-frame deletion/insertion, which could retain
the critical domains of the protein and hence lead to

Evidence of pathogenicity Category
Very strong PVS1 null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multiexon
deletion) in a gene where LOF is a known mechanism of disease
Caveats:
   • Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g., GFAP, MYH7)
• Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3′ end of a gene
• 
Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the
protein intact
• Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts
Strong PS1 Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change
Example:  Val→Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon
Caveat:   Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level
PS2 De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history

Note: Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo
transfer, and so on, can contribute to nonmaternity.
PS3 Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene
product

Note: Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical
diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well established.
PS4 The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence
in controls

Note 1: Relative risk or OR, as obtained from case–control studies, is >5.0, and the confidence interval around
the estimate of relative risk or OR does not include 1.0. See the article for detailed guidance.

Note 2: In instances of very rare variants where case–control studies may not reach statistical significance, the
prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in
controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence.
Moderate PM1 Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g., active site of
an enzyme) without benign variation
PM2 Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) (Table 6) in Exome Sequencing Project,
1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium
Caveat: Population data for insertions/deletions may be poorly called by next-generation sequencing.
PM3 For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant
Note: This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.
PM4 Protein length changes as a result of in-frame deletions/insertions in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss variants
PM5 Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be
pathogenic has been seen before
Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys
Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.
PM6 Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity
Supporting PP1 Cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the
disease
Note: May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data
PP2 Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and in which missense variants
are a common mechanism of disease
PP3 Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product
(conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.)

Caveat: Because many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each
algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of
a variant.
PP4 Patient’s phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology
PP5 Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory
to perform an independent evaluation

either a mild or neutral effect with a minor length
change (PM4) or a gain-of-function effect.
(iv) Considering the presence of alternate gene transcripts
and understanding which are biologically relevant, and
in which tissues the products are expressed, are impor-
tant. If a truncating variant is confined to only one or
not all transcripts, one must be cautious about over-
interpreting variant impact given the presence of the
other protein isoforms.
(v) One must also be cautious in assuming that a null variant
will lead to disease if found in an exon where no other
pathogenic variants have been described, given the pos-
sibility that the exon may be alternatively spliced. This
is particularly true if the predicted truncating variant is
identified as an incidental finding (unrelated to the indi-
cation for testing), given the low prior likelihood of find-
ing a pathogenic variant in that setting.
PS1 same amino acid change
In most cases, when one missense variant is known to be
pathogenic, a different nucleotide change that results in the
same amino acid (e.g., c.34G>C (p.Val12Leu) and c.34G>T
(p.Val12Leu)) can also be assumed to be pathogenic, particu-
larly if the mechanism of pathogenicity occurs through altered
protein function. However, it is important to assess the possibil-
ity that the variant may act directly through the specific DNA
change (e.g., through splicing disruption as assessed by at least
computational analysis) instead of through the amino acid
change, in which case the assumption of pathogenicity may no
longer be valid.
PS2 PM6 de novo variants
A variant observed to have arisen de novo (parental samples
testing negative) is considered strong support for pathogenicity
if the following conditions are met:
(i) Both parental samples were shown through identity test-
ing to be from the biological parents of the patient. Note
that PM6 applies if identity is assumed but not confirmed.
(ii) The patient has a family history of disease that is consis-
tent with de novo inheritance (e.g., unaffected parents for
a dominant disorder). It is possible, however, that more
than one sibling may be affected because of germ-line
mosaicism.
(iii) The phenotype in the patient matches the gene’s disease
association with reasonable specificity. For example, this
argument is strong for a patient with a de novo variant
in the NIPBL gene who has distinctive facial features,
­
hirsutism, and upper-limb defects (i.e., Cornelia de
Lange syndrome), whereas it would be weaker for a de
novo variant found by exome sequencing in a child with
nonspecific features such as developmental delay.
PS3 BS3 functional studies
Functional studies can be a powerful tool in support of patho-
genicity; however, not all functional studies are effective in

Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e., cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation

dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.

ACMG Standards and Guidelines
predicting an impact on a gene or protein function. For exam-
ple, certain enzymatic assays offer well-established approaches
to assess the impact of a missense variant on enzymatic func-
tion in a metabolic pathway (e.g., α-galactosidase enzyme
function). On the other hand, some functional assays may be
less consistent predictors of the effect of variants on protein
function. To assess the validity of a functional assay, one must
consider how closely the functional assay reflects the biologi-
cal environment. For example, assaying enzymatic function
directly from biopsied tissue from the patient or an animal
model provides stronger evidence than expressing the protein
in vitro. Likewise, evidence is stronger if the assay reflects the
full biological function of the protein (e.g., substrate break-
down by an enzyme) compared with only one component of
function (e.g., adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis for a protein
with additional binding properties). Validation, reproducibil-
ity, and robustness data that assess the analytical performance
of the assay and account for specimen integrity, which can be
affected by the method and time of acquisition, as well as stor-
age and transport, are important factors to consider. These fac-
tors are mitigated in the case of an assay in a Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments laboratory–developed test or com-
mercially available kit. Assays that assess the impact of variants
at the messenger RNA level can be highly informative when
evaluating the effects of variants at splice junctions and within
coding sequences and untranslated regions, as well as deeper
intronic regions (e.g., messenger RNA stability, processing,
or translation). Technical approaches include direct analysis
of RNA and/or complementary DNA derivatives and in vitro
minigene splicing assays.
PS4 PM2 BA1 BS1 BS2 variant frequency and use of control
populations
Assessing the frequency of a variant in a control or general
population is useful in assessing its potential pathogenicity.
This can be accomplished by searching publicly available
population databases (e.g., 1000 Genomes Project, National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project
Exome Variant Server, Exome Aggregation Consortium;
Table 1), as well as using race-matched control data that
often are published in the literature. The Exome Sequencing
Project data set is useful for Caucasian and African American
populations and has coverage data to determine whether a
variant is absent. Although the 1000 Genomes Project data
cannot be used to assess the absence of a variant, it has a
broader representation of different racial populations. The
Exome Aggregation Consortium more recently released
allele frequency data from >60,000 exomes from a diverse
set of populations that includes approximately two-thirds of
the Exome Sequencing Project data. In general, an allele fre-
quency in a control population that is greater than expected
for the disorder (Table 6) is considered strong support
for a benign interpretation for a rare Mendelian disorder
(BS1) or, if over 5%, it is considered as stand-alone support
(BA1). Furthermore, if the disease under investigation is
fully penetrant at an early age and the variant is observed
in a well-documented healthy adult individual for a reces-
sive ­
(homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked
­
(hemizygous) condition, then this is considered strong
evidence for a benign interpretation (BS2). If the vari-
ant is absent, one should confirm that the read depth in
the database is sufficient for an accurate call at the variant
site. If a variant is absent from (or below the expected car-
rier frequency if recessive) a large general population or a
control cohort (>1,000 individuals) and the population is
race-matched to the patient harboring the identified variant,
then this observation can be considered a moderate piece of
evidence for pathogenicity (PM2). Many benign variants are
“private” (unique to individuals or families), however, and
therefore absence in a race-matched population is not con-
sidered sufficient or even strong evidence for pathogenicity.
The use of population data for case–control comparisons is
most useful when the populations are well phenotyped, have

large frequency differences, and the Mendelian disease under
study is early onset. Patients referred to a clinical laboratory
for testing are likely to include individuals sent to “rule out”
a disorder, and thus they may not qualify as well-phenotyped
cases. When using a general population as a control cohort,
the presence of individuals with subclinical disease is always a
possibility. In both of these scenarios, however, a case–control
comparison will be underpowered with respect to detecting a
difference; as such, showing a statistically significant difference
can still be assumed to provide supportive evidence for patho-
genicity, as noted above. By contrast, the absence of a statistical
difference, particularly with extremely rare variants and less
penetrant phenotypes, should be interpreted cautiously.
Odds ratios (ORs) or relative risk is a measure of associa-
tion between a genotype (i.e., the variant is present in the
genome) and a phenotype (i.e., affected with the disease/
outcome) and can be used for either Mendelian diseases or
complex traits. In this guideline we are addressing only its
use in Mendelian disease. While relative risk is different from
the OR, relative risk asymptotically approaches ORs for small
probabilities. An OR of 1.0 means that the variant does not
affect the odds of having the disease, values above 1.0 mean
there is an association between the variant and the risk of dis-
ease, and those below 1.0 mean there is a negative association
between the variant and the risk of disease. In general, vari-
ants with a modest Mendelian effect size will have an OR of
3 or greater, whereas highly penetrant variants will have very
high ORs; for example, APOE E4/E4 homozygotes compared
with E3/E3 homozygotes have an OR of 13 (https://www.tgen.
org/home/education-outreach/past-summer-interns/2012-
summer-interns/erika-kollitz.aspx#.VOSi3C7G_vY).
However, the confidence interval (CI) around the OR is as
importantasthemeasureofassociationitself.IftheCIincludes
1.0 (e.g., OR = 2.5, CI = 0.9–7.4), there is little confidence in
Figure 1 Evidence framework. This chart organizes each of the criteria by the type of evidence as well as the strength of the criteria for a benign (left side)

the assertion of association. In the above APOE example the
CI was ~10–16. Very simple OR calculators are available on
the Internet (e.g., http://www.hutchon.net/ConfidOR.htm/
and http://easycalculation.com/statistics/odds-ratio.php/).27,28
PM1 mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-
established functional domain
Certain protein domains are known to be critical to protein
function, and all missense variants in these domains identified
to date have been shown to be pathogenic. These domains must
also lack benign variants. In addition, mutational hotspots in
less well-characterized regions of genes are reported, in which
pathogenic variants in one or several nearby residues have been
observed with greater frequency. Either evidence can be con-
sidered moderate evidence of pathogenicity.
PM3 BP2 cis/trans testing
Testing parental samples to determine whether the variant
occurs in cis (the same copy of the gene) or in trans (different
copies of the gene) can be important for assessing ­pathogenicity.
For example, when two heterozygous variants are identified in a
gene for a recessive disorder, if one variant is known to be patho-
genic, then determining that the other variant is in trans can be
considered moderate evidence for pathogenicity of the latter
variant (PM3). In addition, this evidence could be upgraded to
strong if there are multiple observations of the variant in trans
with other pathogenic variants. If the variant is present among
the general population, however, a statistical approach would
be needed to control for random co-occurrence. By contrast,
finding the second variant in cis would be supporting, though
not definitive, evidence for a benign role (BP2). In the case of
uncertain pathogenicity of two heterozygous variants identi-
fied in a recessive gene, then the determination of the cis versus
trans nature of the variants does not necessarily provide addi-
tional information with regard to the pathogenicity of either
variant. However, the likelihood that both copies of the gene
are impacted is reduced if the variants are found in cis.
In the context of dominant disorders the detection of a
variant in trans with a pathogenic variant can be considered
supporting evidence for a benign impact (BP2) or, in certain
well-developed disease models, may even be considered stand-
alone evidence, as has been validated for use in assessing CFTR
variants.3
PM4 BP3 protein length changes due to in-frame
deletions/insertions and stop losses
The deletion or insertion of one or more amino acids as well
as the extension of a protein by changing the stop codon to an
amino acid codon (e.g., a stop loss variant) is more likely to dis-
rupt protein function compared with a missense change alone
as a result of length changes in the protein. Therefore, in-frame
deletions/insertions and stop losses are considered moderate
evidence of pathogenicity. The larger the deletion, insertion,
or extension, and the more conserved the amino acids are in a
deleted region, the more substantial is the evidence to support
pathogenicity. By contrast, small in-frame deletions/insertions
in repetitive regions, or regions that are not well conserved in
evolution, are less likely to be pathogenic.
PM5 novel missense at the same position
A novel missense amino acid change occurring at the same
position as another pathogenic missense change (e.g.,
Trp38Ser and Trp38Leu) is considered moderate evidence
but cannot be assumed to be pathogenic. This is especially
true if the novel change is more conservative compared with
the established pathogenic missense variant. Also, the differ-
ent amino acid change could lead to a different phenotype.
For example, different substitutions of the Lys650 residue of
the FGFR3 gene are associated with a wide range of clinical
phenotypes: p.Lys650Gln or p.Lys650Asn causes mild hypo-
chondroplasia; p.Lys650Met causes severe achondroplasia
with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans; and
thanatophoric dysplasia type 2, a lethal skeletal dysplasia,
arises from p.Lys650Glu.
PP1 BS4 segregation analysis
Care must be taken when using segregation of a variant in a
family as evidence for pathogenicity. In fact, segregation of
a particular variant with a phenotype in a family is evidence
for linkage of the locus to the disorder but not evidence of
the pathogenicity of the variant itself. A statistical approach
has been published29,30
with the caveat that the identified vari-
ant may be in linkage disequilibrium with the true pathogenic
variant in that family. Statistical modeling takes into account
age-related penetrance and phenocopy rates, with advanced
methods also incorporating in silico predictions and co-occur-
rence with a known pathogenic variant into a single quantita-
tive measure of pathogenicity.31
Distant relatives are important
to include because they are less likely to have both the disease
and the variant by chance than members within a nuclear fam-
ily. Full gene sequencing (including entire introns and 5′ and
3′ untranslated regions) may provide greater evidence that
another variant is not involved or identify additional variants to
consider as possibly causative. Unless the genetic locus is evalu-
ated carefully, one risks misclassifying a nonpathogenic variant
as pathogenic.
When a specific variant in the target gene segregates with a
phenotype or disease in multiple affected family members and
multiple families from diverse ethnic backgrounds, linkage dis-
equilibrium and ascertainment bias are less likely to confound
the evidence for pathogenicity. In this case, this criterion may
be taken as moderate or strong evidence, depending on the
extent of segregation, rather than supporting evidence.
On the other hand, lack of segregation of a variant with a
phenotype provides strong evidence against pathogenicity.
Careful clinical evaluation is needed to rule out mild symptoms
of reportedly unaffected individuals, as well as possible pheno-
copies (affected individuals with disease due to a nongenetic
or ­
different genetic cause). Also, biological family relation-
ships need to be confirmed to rule out adoption, nonpaternity,

sperm and egg donation, and other nonbiological relationships.
Decreased and age-dependent penetrance also must be con-
sidered to ensure that asymptomatic family members are truly
unaffected.
Statistical evaluation of cosegregation may be difficult in the
clinical laboratory setting. If appropriate families are identified,
clinical laboratories are encouraged to work with experts in sta-
tistical or population genetics to ensure proper modeling and
to avoid incorrect conclusions of the relevance of the variant to
the disease.
PP2 BP1 variant spectrum
Many genes have a defined spectrum of pathogenic and benign
variation. For genes in which missense variation is a common
cause of disease and there is very little benign variation in the
gene, a novel missense variant can be considered supporting evi-
dence for pathogenicity (PP2). By contrast, for genes in which
truncating variants are the only known mechanism of variant
pathogenicity, missense variants can be considered supporting
evidence for a benign impact (BP1). For example, truncating
variants in ASPM are the primary type of pathogenic variant in
this gene, which causes autosomal recessive primary microceph-
aly, and the gene has a high rate of missense polymorphic vari-
ants. Therefore missense variants in ASPM can be considered to
have this line of supporting evidence for a benign impact.
PP3 BP4 computational (in silico) data
Not overestimating computational evidence is important, par-
ticularly given that different algorithms may rely on the same (or
similar) data to support predictions and most algorithms have
not been validated against well-established pathogenic variants.
In addition, algorithms can have vastly different predictive capa-
bilities for different genes. If all of the in silico programs tested
agree on the prediction, then this evidence can be counted as
supporting. If in silico predictions disagree, however, then this
evidence should not be used in classifying a ­
variant. The variant
amino acid change being present in multiple nonhuman mam-
malian species in an otherwise well-conserved region, suggest-
ing the amino acid change would not compromise function, can
be considered strong evidence for a benign interpretation. One
must, however, be cautious about assuming a benign impact in a
nonconserved region if the gene has recently evolved in humans
(e.g., genes involved in immune function).
PP4 using phenotype to support variant claims
In general, the fact that a patient has a phenotype that matches
the known spectrum of clinical features for a gene is not con-
sidered evidence for pathogenicity given that nearly all patients
undergoing disease-targeted tests have the phenotype in ques-
tion. If the following criteria are met, however, the patient’s phe-
notype can be considered supporting evidence: (i) the clinical
sensitivity of testing is high, with most patients testing positive
for a pathogenic variant in that gene; (ii) the patient has a well-
defined syndrome with little overlap with other clinical presen-
tations (e.g., Gorlin syndrome including basal cell carcinoma,
palmoplantar pits, odontogenic keratocysts); (iii) the gene is
not subject to substantial benign variation, which can be deter-
mined through large general population cohorts (e.g., Exome
Sequencing Project); and (iv) family history is consistent with
the mode of inheritance of the disorder.
PP5 BP6 reputable source
There are increasing examples where pathogenicity classifica-
tions from a reputable source (e.g., a clinical laboratory with
long-standing expertise in the disease area) have been shared in
databases, yet the evidence that formed the basis for classifica-
tion was not provided and may not be easily obtainable. In this
case, the classification, if recently submitted, can be used as a
single piece of supporting evidence. However, laboratories are
encouraged to share the basis for classification as well as com-
municate with submitters to enable the underlying evidence to
be evaluated and built upon. If the evidence is available, this
criterion should not be used; instead, the criteria relevant to the
evidence should be used.
BP5 alternate locus observations
When a variant is observed in a case with a clear alternate
genetic cause of disease, this is generally considered support-
ing evidence to classify the variant as benign. However, there
are exceptions. An individual can be a carrier of an unrelated
pathogenic variant for a recessive disorder; therefore, this evi-
dence is much stronger support for a likely benign variant clas-
sification in a gene for a dominant disorder compared with a
gene for a recessive disorder. In addition, there are disorders in
which having multiple variants can contribute to more severe
disease. For example, two variants, one pathogenic and one
novel, are identified in a patient with a severe presentation of a
dominant disease. A parent also has mild disease. In this case,
one must consider the possibility that the novel variant could
also be pathogenic and contributing to the increased severity of
disease in the proband. In this clinical scenario, observing the
novel variant as the second variant would not support a benign
classification of the novel variant (though it is also not consid-
ered support for a pathogenic classification without further evi-
dence). Finally, there are certain diseases in which multigenic
inheritance is known to occur, such as Bardet-Beidel syndrome,
in which case the additional variant in the second locus may
also be pathogenic but should be reported with caution.
BP7 synonymous variants
There is increasing recognition that splicing defects, beyond dis-
ruption of the splice consensus sequence, can be an important
mechanism of pathogenicity, particularly for genes in which
loss of function is a common mechanism of disease. Therefore,
one should be cautious in assuming that a synonymous nucleo-
tide change will have no effect. However, if the nucleotide posi-
tion is not conserved over evolution and splicing assessment
algorithms predict neither an impact to a splice consensus
sequence nor the creation of a new alternate splice consen-
sus sequence, then a splicing impact is less likely. Therefore, if
Volume 17 | Number 5 | May 2015 | Genetics in medicine
419
Interpretation of sequence variants | RICHARDS et al ACMG Standards and Guidelines
supported by computational evidence (BP4), one can classify
novel synonymous variants as likely benign. However, if com-
putational evidence suggests a possible impact on splicing or
there is raised suspicion for an impact (e.g., the variant occurs
in trans with a known pathogenic variant in a gene for a reces-
sive disorder), then the variant should be classified as uncertain
significance until a functional evaluation can provide a more
definitive assessment of impact or other evidence is provided to
rule out a pathogenic role.
REPORTING SEQUENCE VARIANTS
Writing succinct yet informative clinical reports can be a chal-
lenge as the complexity of the content grows from reporting
variants in single genes to multigene panels to exomes and
genomes. Several guidance documents have been developed
for reporting, including full sample reports of the ACMG
clinical laboratory standards for next-generation sequencing
guidance.32–35
Clinical reports are the final product of labora-
tory testing and often are integrated into a patient’s electronic
health record. Therefore, effective reports are concise, yet easy
to understand. Reports should be written in clear language that
avoids medical genetics jargon or defines such terms when
used. The report should contain all of the essential elements of
the test performed, including structured results, an interpre-
tation, references, methodology, and appropriate disclaimers.
These essential elements of the report also are emphasized by
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments regulations
and the College of American Pathologists laboratory standards
for next-generation sequencing clinical tests.36
Results
The results section should list variants using HGVS nomencla-
ture (see Nomenclature). Given the increasing number of vari-
ants found in genetic tests, presenting the variants in tabular
form with essential components may best convey the infor-
mation. These components include nomenclature at both the
nucleotide (genomic and complementary DNA) and protein
level, gene name, disease, inheritance, exon, zygosity, and vari-
ant classification. An example of a table to report structured ele-
ments of a variant is found in the Supplementary Appendix
S1 online. Parental origin may also be included if known. In
addition, if specific variants are analyzed in a genotyping test,
the laboratory should specifically note the variants interro-
gated, with their full description and historical nomenclature
if it exists. Furthermore, when reporting results from exome or
genome sequencing, or occasionally very large disease-targeted
panels, grouping variants into categories such as “Variants
in Disease Genes with an Established Association with the
Reported Phenotype,” “Variants in Disease Genes with a Likely
Association with the Reported Phenotype,” and (where appro-
priate) “Incidental (Secondary) Findings” may be beneficial.
Interpretation
The interpretation should contain the evidence supporting
the variant classification, including its predicted effect on the
resultant protein and whether any variants identified are likely
to fully or partially explain the patient’s indication for testing.
The report also should include any recommendations to the
clinician for supplemental clinical testing, such as enzymatic/
functional testing of the patient’s cells and variant testing of
family members, to further inform variant interpretation. The
interpretation section should address all variants described in
the results section but may contain additional information. It
should be noted whether the variant has been reported previ-
ously in the literature or in disease or control databases. The
references, if any, that contributed to the classification should
be cited where discussed and listed at the end of the report. The
additional information described in the interpretation section
may include a summarized conclusion of the results of in silico
analyses and evolutionary conservation analyses. However,
individual computational predictions (e.g., scores, terms such
as “damaging”) should be avoided given the high likelihood of
misinterpretation by health-care providers who may be unfa-
miliar with the limitations of predictive algorithms (see In
Silico Predictive Programs, above). A discussion of decreased
penetrance and variable expressivity of the disorder, if relevant,
should be included in the final report. Examples of how to
describe evidence for variant classification on clinical reports
are found in the Supplementary Appendix S1 online.
Methodology
The methods and types of variants detected by the assay and
those refractory to detection should be provided in the report.
Limitations of the assay used to detect the variants also should
be reported. Methods should include those used to obtain
nucleic acids (e.g., polymerase chain reaction, capture, whole-
genome amplification), as well as those to analyze the nucleic
acids (e.g., bidirectional Sanger sequencing, next-generation
sequencing, chromosomal microarray, genotyping technolo-
gies), because this may provide the health-care provider with
the necessary information to decide whether additional testing
is required to follow up on the results. The methodology section
should also give the official gene names approved by the Human
Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee, RefSeq
accession numbers for transcripts, and genome build, includ-
ing versions. For large panels, gene-level information may be
posted and referenced by URL. The laboratory may choose to
add a disclaimer that addresses general pitfalls in laboratory
testing, such as sample quality and sample mix-up.
Access to patient advocacy groups, clinical trials, and
research
Although specific clinical guidance for a patient is not recom-
mended for laboratory reports, provision of general informa-
tion for categories of results (e.g., all positives) is appropriate
and helpful. A large number of patient advocacy groups and
clinical trials are now available for support and treatment of
many diseases. Laboratories may choose to add this infor-
mation to the body of the report or attach the information
so it is sent to the health-care provider along with the report.
Genetics in medicine | Volume 17 | Number 5 | May 2015
420
RICHARDS et al | Interpretation of sequence variants
ACMG Standards and Guidelines
Laboratories may make an effort to connect the health-care
provider to research groups working on specific diseases when
a variant’s effect is classified as “uncertain,” as long as Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act patient privacy
requirements are followed.
Variant reanalysis
As evidence on variants evolves, previous classifications may
later require modification. For example, the availability of
variant frequency data among large populations has led many
uncertain significance variants to be reclassified as benign, and
testing additional family members may result in the reclassifi-
cation of variants.
As the content of sequencing tests expands and the num-
ber of variants identified grows, expanding to thousands and
millions of variants from exome and genome sequencing, the
ability for laboratories to update reports as variant knowledge
changes will be untenable without appropriate mechanisms and
resources to sustain those updates. To set appropriate expec-
tations with health-care providers and patients, laboratories
should provide clear policies on the reanalysis of data from
genetic testing and whether additional charges for reanalysis
may apply. Laboratories are encouraged to explore innovative
approaches to give patients and providers more efficient access
to updated information.37,38
For reports containing variants of uncertain significance in
genes related to the primary indication, and in the absence of
updates that may be proactively provided by the laboratory, it
is recommended that laboratories suggest periodic inquiry by
health-care providers to determine whether knowledge of any
variants of uncertain significance, including variants reported
as likely pathogenic, has changed. By contrast, laboratories
are encouraged to consider proactive amendment of cases
when a variant reported with a near-definitive classification
(pathogenic or benign) must be reclassified. Regarding physi-
cian responsibility, see the ACMG guidelines on the duty to
recontact.39
Confirmation of findings
Recommendations for the confirmation of reported variants is
addressed elsewhere.35,36
Except as noted, confirmation studies
using an orthogonal method are recommended for all sequence
variants that are considered to be pathogenic or likely patho-
genic for a Mendelian disorder. These methods may include,
but are not limited to, re-extraction of the sample and testing,
testing of parents, restriction enzyme digestion, sequencing the
area of interest a second time, or using an alternate genotyping
technology.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Evaluating and reporting variants in GUS based on the
indication for testing
Genome and exome sequencing are identifying new genotype–
phenotype connections. When the laboratory finds a vari-
ant in a gene without a validated association to the patient’s
phenotype, it is a GUS. This can occur when a gene has never
been associated with any patient phenotype or when the gene
has been associated with a different phenotype from that under
consideration. Special care must be taken when applying the
recommended guidelines to a GUS. In such situations, utilizing
variant classification rules developed for recognized genotype–
phenotype associations is not appropriate. For example, when
looking across the exome or genome, a de novo observation is
no longer strong evidence for pathogenicity given that all indi-
viduals are expected to have approximately one de novo vari-
ant in their exome or 100 in their genome. Likewise, thousands
of variants across a genome could segregate with a significant
logarithm of the odds (LOD) score. Furthermore, many delete-
rious variants that are clearly disruptive to a gene or its resultant
protein (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1,2 splice site, exon-
level deletion) may be detected; however, this is insufficient
evidence for a causative role in any given disease presentation.
Variants found in a GUS may be considered as candidates
and reported as “variants in a gene of uncertain significance.”
These variants, if reported, should always be classified as uncer-
tain significance. Additional evidence would be required to
support the gene’s association to disease before any variant in
the gene itself can be considered pathogenic for that disease.5
For example, additional cases with matching rare phenotypes
and deleterious variants in the same gene would enable the
individual variants to be classified according to the recommen-
dations presented here.
Evaluating variants in healthy individuals or as incidental
findings
Caution must be exercised when using these guidelines to
evaluate variants in healthy or asymptomatic individuals or to
interpret incidental findings unrelated to the primary indica-
tion for testing. In these cases the likelihood of any identified
variant being pathogenic may be far less than when performing
disease-targeted testing. As such, the required evidence to call a
variant pathogenic should be higher, and extra caution should
be exercised. In addition, the predicted penetrance of patho-
genic variants found in the absence of a phenotype or family
history may be far less than predicted based on historical data
from patients ascertained as having disease.
Mitochondrial variants
The interpretation of mitochondrial variants other than well-
established pathogenic variants is complex and remains chal-
lenging; several special considerations are addressed here.
The nomenclature differs from standard nomenclature
for nuclear genes, using gene name and m. numbering (e.g.,
m.8993T>C) and p. numbering, but not the standard c. num-
bering (see also Nomenclature). The current accepted reference
sequence is the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence of the
Human Mitochondrial DNA: GenBank sequence NC_012920
gi:251831106.40,41
Heteroplasmy or homoplasmy should be reported, along
with an estimate of heteroplasmy of the variant if the test has
Volume 17 | Number 5 | May 2015 | Genetics in medicine
421
Interpretation of sequence variants | RICHARDS et al ACMG Standards and Guidelines
been validated to determine heteroplasmy levels. Heteroplasmy
percentages in different tissue types may vary from the sample
tested; therefore, low heteroplasmic levels also must be inter-
preted in the context of the tissue tested, and they may be
meaningful only in the affected tissue such as muscle. Over
275 mitochondrial DNA variants relating to disease have
been recorded (http://mitomap.org/bin/view.pl/MITOMAP/
WebHome).42
MitoMap is considered the main source of infor-
mation related to mitochondrial variants as well as ­
haplotypes.
Other resources, such as frequency information (http://www.
mtdb.igp.uu.se/),43
secondary structures, sequences, and
alignment of mitochondrial transfer RNAs (http://mamit-
trna.u-strasbg.fr/),44
mitochondrial haplogroups (http://www.
phylotree.org/)45
and other information (http://www.mtdna-
community.org/default.aspx),46
may prove useful in interpret-
ing mitochondrial variants.
Given the difficulty in assessing mitochondrial variants, a
separate evidence checklist has not been included. However,
any evidence needs to be applied with additional caution (for
a review, see ref. 47
). The genes in the mitochondrial genome
encode for transfer RNA as well as for protein; therefore, evalu-
ating amino acid changes is relevant only for genes encoding
proteins. Similarly, because many mitochondrial variants are
missense variants, evidence criteria for truncating variants
likely will not be helpful. Because truncating variants do not fit
the known variant spectrum in most mitochondrial genes, their
significance may be uncertain. Although mitochondrial vari-
ants are typically maternally inherited, they can be sporadic, yet
de novo variants are difficult to assess because of heteroplasmy
that may be below an assay’s detection level or different between
tissues. The level of heteroplasmy may contribute to the variable
expression and reduced penetrance that occurs within families.
Nevertheless, there remains a lack of correlation between the
percentage of heteroplasmy and disease severity.47
Muscle, liver,
or urine may be additional specimen types useful for clinical
evaluation. Undetected heteroplasmy may also affect outcomes
of case, case–control, and familial concordance studies. In addi-
tion, functional studies are not readily available, although eval-
uating muscle morphology may be helpful (i.e., the presence of
ragged red fibers). Frequency data and published studies dem-
onstrating causality may often be the only assessable criteria
on the checklist. An additional tool for mitochondrial diseases
may be haplogroup analysis, but this may not represent a rou-
tine method that clinical laboratories have used, and the clinical
correlation is not easy to interpret.
Consideration should be given to testing nuclear genes asso-
ciated with mitochondrial disorders because variants in nuclear
genes could be causative of oxidative disorders or modulating
the mitochondrial variants.
Pharmacogenomics
Establishing the effects of variants in genes involved with drug
metabolism is challenging, in part because a phenotype is
only apparent upon exposure to a drug. Still, variants in genes
related to drug efficacy and risk for adverse events have been
described and are increasingly used in clinical care. Gene sum-
maries and clinically relevant variants can be found in the
Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (http://www.pharmgkb.
org/).48
Alleles and nomenclature for the cytochrome P450 gene
family is available at http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/.49
Although the
interpretation of PGx variants is beyond the scope of this docu-
ment, we include a discussion of the challenges and distinctions
associated with the interpretation and reporting of PGx results.
The traditional nomenclature of PGx alleles uses star (*)
alleles, which often represent haplotypes, or a combination of
variants on the same allele. Traditional nucleotide number-
ing using outdated reference sequences is still being applied.
Converting traditional nomenclature to standardized nomen-
clature using current reference sequences is an arduous task,
but it is necessary for informatics applications with next-gen-
eration sequencing.
Many types of variants have been identified in PGx genes,
such as truncating, missense, deletions, duplications (of func-
tional as well as nonfunctional alleles), and gene conversions,
resulting in functional, partially functional (decreased or
reducedfunction),andnonfunctional(null)alleles.Interpreting
sequence variants often requires determining haplotype from
a combination of variants detected. Haplotypes are typically
presumed based on population frequencies and known variant
associations rather than testing directly for chromosomal phase
(molecular haplotyping).
In addition, for many PGx genes (particularly variants in
genes coding for enzymes), the overall phenotype is derived
from a diplotype, which is the combination of variants or hap-
lotypes on both alleles. Because PGx variants do not directly
cause disease, using terms related to metabolism (rapid, inter-
mediate, poor); efficacy (resistant, responsive, sensitive); or
“risk,” rather than pathogenic, may be more appropriate.
Further nomenclature and interpretation guidelines are needed
to establish consistency in this field.
Common complex disorders
Unlike Mendelian diseases, the identification of common, com-
plex disease genes, such as those contributing to type 2 diabetes,
coronary artery disease, and hypertension, has largely relied on
population-based approaches (e.g., genome-wide association
studies) rather than family-based studies.50,51
Currently, numer-
ous genome-wide association study reports have resulted in the
cataloguing of over 1,200 risk alleles for common, complex dis-
eases and traits. Most of these variants are in nongenic regions,
however, and additional studies are required to determine
whether any of the variants are directly causal through effects
on regulatory elements, for example, or are in linkage disequi-
librium with causal variants.52
Common, complex risk alleles typically confer low rela-
tive risk and are meager in their predictive power.53
To date,
the utility of common, complex risk allele testing for patient
care54
has been unclear, and models to combine multiple
markers into a cumulative risk score often are flawed and are
usually no better than traditional risk factors such as family

history, demographics, and nongenetic clinical phenotypes.55,56
Moreover, in almost all of the common diseases the risk alleles
can explain only up to 10% of the variance in the population,
even when the disease has high heritability. Given the com-
plexity of issues, this recommendation does not address the
interpretation and reporting of complex trait alleles. We rec-
ognize, however, that some of these alleles are identified dur-
ing the course of sequencing Mendelian genes, and therefore
guidance on how to report such alleles when found incidentally
is needed. The terms “pathogenic” and “likely pathogenic” are
not appropriate in this context, even when the association is
statistically valid. Until better guidance is developed, an interim
solution is to report these variants as “risk alleles” or under a
separate “other reportable” category in the diagnostic report.
The evidence for the risk, as identified in the case–control/
genome-wide association studies, can be expressed by modify-
ing the terms, such as “established risk allele,” “likely risk allele,”
or “uncertain risk allele,” if desired.
Somatic variants
The description of somatic variants, primarily those observed
in cancer cells, includes complexities not encountered with
constitutional variants, because the allele ratios are highly
variable and tumor heterogeneity can cause sampling dif-
ferences. Interpretation helps select therapy and predicts
treatment response or the prognosis of overall survival or
tumor progression–free survival, further complicating vari-
ant classification. For the interpretation of negative results,
understanding the limit of detection of the sequencing
assay (at what allele frequency the variant can be detected
by the assay) is important and requires specific knowledge
of the tumor content of the sample. Variant classification
­
categories are also different, with somatic variants compared
with germ-line variants, with terms such as “responsive,”
­
“resistant,” “driver,” and “passenger” often used. Whether a
variant is truly somatic is confirmed by sequence analysis of
the patient’s germ-line DNA. A different set of interpretation
guidelines is needed for somatic variants, with tumor-specific
databases used for reference, in addition to databases used
for constitutional findings. To address this, a workgroup has
recently been formed by the AMP.
HOW SHOULD HEALTH-CARE PROVIDERS USE
THESE GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS?
The primary purpose of clinical laboratory testing is to support
medical decision making. In the clinic, genetic testing is gener-
ally used to identify or confirm the cause of disease and to help
the health-care provider make individualized treatment deci-
sions including the choice of medication. Given the complexity
of genetic testing, results are best realized when the referring
health-care provider and the clinical laboratory work collabora-
tively in the testing process.
When a health-care provider orders genetic testing, the
patient’s clinical information is integral to the laboratory’s
analysis. As health-care providers increasingly utilize genomic
(exome or genome) sequencing, the need for detailed clini-
cal information to aid in interpretation assumes increasing
importance. For example, when a laboratory finds a rare or
novel variant in a genomic sequencing sample, the director
cannot assume it is relevant to a patient just because it is rare,
novel, or de novo. The laboratory must evaluate the variant
and the gene in the context of the patient’s and family’s his-
tory, physical examinations, and previous laboratory tests
to distinguish between variants that cause the patient’s dis-
order and those that are incidental (secondary) findings or
benign. Indeed, accurate and complete clinical information
is so essential for the interpretation of genome-level DNA
sequence findings that the laboratory can reasonably refuse to
proceed with the testing if such information is not provided
with the test sample.
For tests that cover a broad range of phenotypes (large panels,
exome and genome sequencing) the laboratory may find candi-
date causative variants. Further follow-up with the health-care
provider and patient may uncover additional evidence to sup-
port a variant. These additional phenotypes may be subclinical,
requiring additional clinical evaluation to detect (e.g., tempo-
ral bone abnormalities detected by computed tomography in a
hearing-impairedpatientwithanuncertainvariantinSLC26A4,
the gene associated with Pendred syndrome). In addition, test-
ing other family members to establish when a variant is de
novo, when a variant cosegregates with disease in the family,
and when a variant is in trans with a pathogenic variant in the
same recessive disease-causing gene is valuable. Filtering out or
discounting the vast majority of variants for dominant diseases
when they can be observed in healthy relatives is possible, mak-
ing the interpretation much more efficient and conclusive. To
this end, it is strongly recommended that every effort be made
to include parental samples along with that of the proband,
so-called “trio” testing (mother, father, affected child), in the
setting of exome and genome sequencing, particularly for sus-
pected recessive or de novo causes. Obviously this will be easier
to achieve for pediatric patients than for affected adults. In the
absence of one or both parents, the inclusion of affected and
unaffected siblings can be of value.
Many genetic variants can result in a range of phenotypic
expression (variable expressivity), and the chance of disease
developing may not be 100% (reduced penetrance), further
underscoring the importance of providing comprehensive
clinical data to the clinical laboratory to aid in variant interpre-
tation. Ideally, it is recommended that clinical data be depos-
ited into, and shared via, centralized repositories as allowable
by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and
institutional review board regulations. Importantly, referring
health-care providers can further assist clinical laboratories by
recruiting DNA from family members in scenarios where their
participation will be required to interpret results, (e.g., when
evaluating cosegregation with disease using affected family
members, genotyping parents to assess for de novo occurrence
and determining the phase of variants in recessive disorders
using first-degree relatives).

Interpretation of sequence variants | RICHARDS et al ACMG Standards and Guidelines
A key issue for health-care providers is how to use the evi-
dence provided by genetic testing in medical management
decisions. Variant analysis is, at present, imperfect, and the
variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty. In
general, a variant classified as pathogenic using the proposed
classification scheme has met criteria informed by empirical
data such that a health-care provider can use the molecular
testing information in clinical decision making. Efforts should
be made to avoid using this as the sole evidence of Mendelian
disease; it should be used in conjunction with other clinical
information when possible. Typically, a variant classified as
likely pathogenic has sufficient evidence that a health-care
provider can use the molecular testing information in clini-
cal decision making when combined with other evidence of
the disease in question. For example, in the prenatal setting an
ultrasound may show a key confirmatory finding; in postnatal
cases, other data such as enzyme assays, physical findings, or
imaging studies may conclusively support decision making.
However, it is recommended that all possible follow-up test-
ing, as described above, be pursued to generate additional evi-
dence related to a likely pathogenic variant because this may
permit the variant to be reclassified as pathogenic. A variant of
uncertain significance should not be used in clinical decision
making. Efforts to resolve the classification of the variant as
pathogenic or benign should be undertaken. While this effort
to reclassify the variant is underway, additional monitoring
of the patient for the disorder in question may be prudent. A
variant considered likely benign has sufficient evidence that a
health-care provider can conclude that it is not the cause of
the patient’s disorder when combined with other information,
for example, if the variant does not segregate in an affected
family member and complex inheritance patterns are unlikely.
A variant considered benign has sufficient evidence that a
health-care provider can conclude that it is not the cause of the
patient’s disorder.
How the genetic testing evidence is used is also dependent
on the clinical context and indication for testing. In a prenatal
diagnostic case where a family is considering irrevocable deci-
sions such as fetal treatment or pregnancy termination, the
weight of evidence from the report and other sources such as
fetal ultrasound needs to be considered before action is taken.
When a genetic test result is the only evidence in a prenatal set-
ting, variants considered likely pathogenic must be explained
carefully to families. It is therefore critical for referring health-
care providers to communicate with the clinical laboratory to
gain an understanding of how variants are classified to assist in
patient counseling and management.
