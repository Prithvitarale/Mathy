Abstract Much biomedical research is observational.The reporting of such research is often inadequate,which hampers the assessment
ofitsstrengthsandweaknessesandofastudy’sgeneralizability.TheStrengtheningtheReportingofObservationalStudiesinEpidemiology
(STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational
study.We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs:cohort,case-control and cross-sectional studies.
We convened a two-day workshop,in September 2004,with methodologists,researchers and journal editors to draft a checklist of items.
This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group
of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations.The workshop and the subsequent
iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract,
introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are
specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately
and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE
Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.

Introduction
Manyquestionsinmedicalresearcharein-
vestigated in observational studies.1
Much
of the research into the cause of diseases
relies on cohort, case-control or cross-
sectional studies. Observational studies
alsohavearoleinresearchintothebenefits
andharmsofmedicalinterventions.2
Ran-
domizedtrialscannotanswerallimportant
questions about a given intervention. For
example, observational studies are more
suitable to detect rare or late adverse ef-
fects of treatments, and are more likely to
provide an indication of what is achieved
in daily medical practice.3
Researchshouldbereportedtranspar-
ently so that readers can follow what was
planned, what was done, what was found,
and what conclusions were drawn. The
credibility of research depends on a critical
assessment by others of the strengths and
weaknesses in study design, conduct and
analysis. Transparent reporting is also
needed to judge whether and how results
can be included in systematic reviews.4,5
However, in published observational
research important information is often
missing or unclear. An analysis of epide-
miological studies published in general
medical and specialist journals found that
therationalebehindthechoiceofpotential
confoundingvariableswasoftennotreport-
ed.6
Onlyfewreportsofcase-controlstudies
in psychiatry explained the methods used
to identify cases and controls.7
In a survey
of longitudinal studies in stroke research,
17 of 49 articles (35%) did not specify the
eligibilitycriteria.8
Othershavearguedthat
without sufficient clarity of reporting, the

andthatthereisaneedforguidance

Recommendations on the report-
ing of research can improve reporting
quality. The Consolidated Standards of
ReportingTrials(CONSORT)Statement
was developed in 1996 and revised five
years later.12
Many medical journals sup-
ported this initiative,13
which has helped
to improve the quality of reports of
randomized trials.14,15
Similar initiatives
have followed for other research areas –

of randomized trials16
or diagnostic
studies.17
We established a network of
methodologists, researchers and journal
editors to develop recommendations for
the reporting of observational research:
the Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) Statement.
Aims and use of the STROBE
Statement
The STROBE Statement is a checklist of
items that should be addressed in articles
reporting on the three main study designs
of analytical epidemiology: cohort, case-
control and cross-sectional studies. The
intention is solely to provide guidance
on how to report observational research
well: these recommendations are not
prescriptions for designing or conducting
studies. Also, while clarity of reporting is a
prerequisite to evaluation, the checklist is
not an instrument to evaluate the quality
of observational research.
Here we present the STROBE State-
ment and explain how it was developed.
In a detailed companion paper, the
Explanation and Elaboration article,18–20
we justify the inclusion of the different
checklist items, and give methodological
background and published examples of
what we consider transparent report-
ing. We strongly recommend using the
STROBE checklist in conjunction with
the explanatory article, which is available
freely on the web sites of PLoS Medicine
(www.plosmedicine.org), Annals of
Internal Medicine (www.annals.org) and
Epidemiology (www.epidem.com).
Development of the STROBE
Statement
We established the STROBE Initiative
in 2004, obtained funding for a work-
shop and set up a web site (www.strobe-
statement.org). We searched textbooks,
bibliographic databases, reference lists
and personal files for relevant material,
including previous recommendations,
empirical studies of reporting and arti-
cles describing relevant methodological
research. Because observational research
makes use of many different study de-
signs, we felt that the scope of STROBE
had to be clearly defined early on. We
decided to focus on the three study
designs that are used most widely in ana-
lytical observational research: cohort,
case-control and cross-sectional studies.
We organized a two-day workshop
in Bristol, the United Kingdom, in Sep-
tember 2004. Twenty-three individu-
als attended this meeting, including
editorial staff from Annals of Internal
Medicine, BMJ, Bulletin of the World
Health Organization, International Jour-
nal of Epidemiology, JAMA, Preventive
Medicine and The Lancet as well as epi-
demiologists, methodologists, statisti-
cians and practitioners from Europe and
North America. Written contributions
were sought from 10 other individuals
who declared an interest in contribut-
ing to STROBE, but could not attend.
Three working groups identified items
deemed to be important to include in
checklists for each type of study. A pro-
visional list of items prepared in advance
(available from our web site) was used
to facilitate discussions. The three draft
checklists were then discussed by all
participants and, where possible, items
were revised to make them applicable to
all three study designs. In a final plenary
session, the group decided on the strat-
egy for finalizing and disseminating the
STROBE Statement.
After the workshop we drafted a
combined checklist including all three
designs and made it available on our
web site. We invited participants and
additional scientists and editors to
comment on this draft checklist. We
subsequently published three revisions
on the web site, and two summaries of
comments received and changes made.
During this process the coordinating
group (i.e. the authors of the present
paper) met on eight occasions for one
or two days, and held several telephone
conferences to revise the checklist and
to prepare the present paper and the
Explanation and Elaboration paper.18–20
The coordinating group invited three
additional co-authors with method-
ological and editorial expertise to help
write the Explanation and Elaboration
paper, and sought feedback from more
than 30 people, who are listed at the end
of this paper. We allowed several weeks
for comments on subsequent drafts of
the paper and reminded collaborators
about deadlines by e-mail.
STROBE components
The STROBE Statement is a checklist of
22 items that we consider essential for
good reporting of observational studies
(see Table 1). These items relate to the
article’s title and abstract (item 1), the
introduction (items 2 and 3), methods
(items 4–12), results (items 13–17),
discussion sections (items 18–21) and
other information (item 22 on fund-
ing). Eighteen items are common to all
three designs, while four (items 6, 12,
14 and 15) are design-specific, with dif-
ferent versions for all or part of the item.
For some items (indicated by footnote a
),
information should be given separately
for cases and controls in case-control
studies, or exposed and unexposed
groups in cohort and cross-sectional
studies. Although presented here as a
single checklist, separate checklists are
available for each of the three study de-
signs on the STROBE web site.
Implications and limitations
The STROBE Statement was developed
to assist authors when writing up ana-
lytical observational studies, to support
editors and reviewers when considering
such articles for publication, and to
help readers when critically appraising
published articles. We developed the
checklist through an open process, tak-
ing into account the experience gained
with previous initiatives, in particular
CONSORT. We reviewed the relevant
empirical evidence as well as method-
ological work, and subjected consecutive
drafts to an extensive iterative process
of consultation. The checklist presented
here is thus based on input from a large
number of individuals with diverse
backgrounds and perspectives. The
comprehensive explanatory article,18–20
which is intended for use alongside the
checklist, also benefited greatly from this
consultation process.
Observational studies serve a wide
range of purposes, on a continuum from
the discovery of new findings to the
confirmation or refutation of previous
findings.18–20
Some studies are essen-
tially exploratory and raise interesting
hypotheses. Others pursue clearly de-
fined hypotheses in available data. In yet
another type of studies, the collection
of new data is planned carefully on the
basis of an existing hypothesis. We
believe the present checklist can be
useful for all these studies, since the
readers always need to know what was
planned (and what was not), what was
done, what was found, and what the
results mean. We acknowledge that
STROBE is currently limited to three
main observational study designs. We
would welcome extensions that adapt

the checklist to other designs – e.g.
case-crossover studies or ecological stud-
ies – and also to specific topic areas.
Four extensions are now available for
the CONSORT Statement.21–24
A first
extension to STROBE is under way for
gene–disease association studies: the
STROBE Extension to Genetic Associa-
tion studies (STREGA) initiative.25
We
ask those who aim to develop extensions
of the STROBE Statement to contact
the coordinating group first to avoid
duplication of effort.
The STROBE Statement should not
be interpreted as an attempt to prescribe
the reporting of observational research
in a rigid format. The checklist items
should be addressed in sufficient detail
and with clarity somewhere in an article,
but the order and format for presenting
information depends on author prefer-
ences, journal style and the traditions of
the research field. For instance, we discuss
the reporting of results under several
separate items, while recognizing that au-
thors might address several items within
a single section of text or in a table. Also,
item 22, on the source of funding and the
role of funders, could be addressed in an
appendix or in the methods section of the
article. We do not aim at standardizing
reporting. Authors of randomized clinical
trials were asked by an editor of a special-
ist medical journal to “CONSORT”
their manuscripts on submission.26
We
believe that manuscripts should not be
“STROBEd”, in the sense of regulat-
ing style or terminology. We encourage
authors to use narrative elements, includ-
ing the description of illustrative cases,
to complement the essential informa-
tion about their study, and to make their
articles an interesting read.27
We emphasize that the STROBE
Statement was not developed as a tool
for assessing the quality of published
observational research. Such instru-
ments have been developed by other
groups and were the subject of a recent
systematic review.28
In the Explanation
and Elaboration paper, we used several
examples of good reporting from stud-
ies whose results were not confirmed in
further research – the important feature
was the good reporting, not whether the
research was of good quality. However,
if STROBE is adopted by authors and
journals, issues such as confounding, bias
and generalizability could become more
transparent, which might help temper
the over-enthusiastic reporting of new
findings in the scientific community
and popular media,29
and improve the
methodology of studies in the long
term. Better reporting may also help to
have more informed decisions about
when new studies are needed and what
they should address.
We did not undertake a compre-
hensive systematic review for each of the
checklist items and sub-items, or do our
own research to fill gaps in the evidence
base. Further, although no one was
excluded from the process, the composi-
tion of the group of contributors was
influenced by existing networks and was
not representative in terms of geography
(it was dominated by contributors from
EuropeandNorthAmerica)andprobably
wasnotrepresentativeintermsofresearch
interests and disciplines. We stress that
STROBE and other recommendations
on the reporting of research should be
seen as evolving documents that require
continual assessment, refinement, and,
if necessary, change. We welcome sug-
gestions for the further dissemination of
STROBE – e.g. by re-publication of the
present article in specialist journals and
in journals published in other languages.
Groups or individuals who intend to
translate the checklist to other languages
should consult the coordinating group
beforehand.We will revise the checklist in
thefuture,takingintoaccountcomments,

Résumé
Déclaration de l’Initiative STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology) : recommandations pour l’élaboration des rapports d’études observationnelles
Les recherches menées dans le domaine biomédical sont pour
une grande part de nature observationnelle. Les rapports de ces
études sont souvent inadéquats, ce qui empêche l’évaluation
des points forts et des défauts de l’étude et sa généralisation.
L’Initiative STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology) a élaboré des recommandations sur ce
que doit être le contenu d’un rapport complet et précis d’étude
observationnelle. Nous avons défini le champ d’application
de ces recommandations comme couvrant les trois principaux
types d’étude, à savoir les études de cohorte, cas-témoins et
transversales. En septembre 2004, dans le cadre d’un atelier
de deux jours, nous avons invité des méthodologistes, des
chercheurs et des éditeurs de revue à élaborer une liste de points
à considérer. Cette liste a ensuite été révisée dans le cadre de
plusieurs réunions du groupe coordinateur et de discussions par
courrier électronique avec le groupe plus large des contributeurs
à l’Initiative STROBE, en tenant compte de résultats empiriques
et de considérations méthodologiques. L’atelier et le processus
itératif ultérieur de consultation et de révision ont débouché sur
une liste de contrôle en 22 points (la déclaration STROBE)
concernant le titre, le résumé, l’introduction, la méthodologie
et les parties Résultats et Discussion des articles. Dix-huit
points s’appliquent collectivement aux trois types d’étude et
quatre spécifiquement aux études de cohortes, cas-témoins ou
transversales.Un document intituléExplanation and Elaborationest
publié séparément et accessible gratuitement sur les sites Internet
PloS Medicine,Annals of Internal Medicine et Epidemiology. Nous
espérons que la déclaration STROBE contribuera à l’amélioration
de la qualité des rapports d’étude observationnelle.
Gran parte de la investigación biomédica es de tipo observacional,
pero la información difundida sobre esas investigaciones es a
menudo insuficiente, lo que dificulta la evaluación de sus puntos
fuertes y débiles y de su generalizabilidad de las conclusiones.
En el marco de la iniciativa de Fortalecimiento de la Notificación
de los Estudios Observacionales en Epidemiología (STROBE), se
formularon recomendaciones sobre lo que debería contener una
notificación precisa de un estudio observacional. Decidimos limitar
el alcance de las recomendaciones a tres grandes modalidades
de estudio: estudios de cohortes, estudios de casos y controles,
y estudios transversales. En septiembre de 2004 organizamos un
taller de dos días con metodólogos, investigadores y editores de
revistas para elaborar una lista de verificación de distintos puntos.
Esta lista fue revisada posteriormente en varias reuniones del
grupo de coordinación y en discusiones mantenidas por e-mail
Resumen
Declaración de la Iniciativa STOBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology): directrices para informar sobre los estudios observacionales
con los principales participantes en STROBE, teniendo en cuenta
la evidencia empírica y diversas consideraciones metodológicas.
El taller y el posterior proceso iterativo de consulta y revisión
desembocaron en una lista de verificación de 22 puntos (la
declaración STROBE) que guardan relación con el título, el
resumen, la introducción y las secciones de métodos, resultados
y discusión de los artículos. Dieciocho puntos son comunes a las
tres modalidades de estudio, y cuatro se refieren específicamente
a los estudios de cohortes, de casos y controles o transversales.
Se ha publicado separadamente un documento de Explicación y
elaboración al que puede accederse libremente en los sitios web
de PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine y Epidemiology.
Esperamos que la declaración STROBE contribuya a mejorar la
calidad de la notificación de los estudios observacionales.
