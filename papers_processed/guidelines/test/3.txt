ABSTRACT
Process models constitute crucial artifacts in modern information systems and, hence, the proper
comprehension of these models is of utmost importance in the utilization of such systems. Generally,
process models are considered from two different perspectives: process modelers and readers. Both
perspectives share similarities and differences in the comprehension of process models (e.g., diverse
experiences when working with process models). The literature proposed many rules and guidelines
to ensure a proper comprehension of process models for both perspectives. As a novel contribution
in this context, this paper introduces the Process Model Comprehension Framework (PMCF) as a
first step towards the measurement and quantification of the perspectives of process modelers and
readers as well as the interaction of both regarding the comprehension of process models. Therefore,
the PMCF describes an Evaluation Theory Tree based on the Communication Theory as well as
the Conceptual Modeling Quality Framework and considers a total of 96 quality metrics in order
to quantify process model comprehension. Furthermore, the PMCF was evaluated in a survey with
131 participants and has been implemented as well as applied successfully in a practical case study
including 33 participants. To conclude, the PMCF allows for the identification of pitfalls and provides
related information about how to assist process modelers as well as readers in order to foster and
enable a proper comprehension of process models.

1 Introduction
Business Process Management (BPM) describes the discipline in bridging the gap between business, technology, and
human workers in organizations [1]. In more detail, modern information technologies (e.g., process-aware information
systems; PAIS) are the enabler towards the automation of the processes in organizations and comprising the interaction
between humans and the application of technology (i.e., human-driven processes) [2]. As a prerequisite for the
successful utilization of PAIS, it must be ensured that the numerous processes of organizations are comprehended
correctly and that respective information as well as knowledge about these processes are proper documented; either
textually or visually [3]. Thereby, in order to sustain competitive advantage, an easy to comprehend and correct
documentation of process information and knowledge is essential [4]. In this context, an established approach to
document process information and knowledge is to rely on the technique of process modeling, in which respective

information as well as knowledge are visually documented in process models. More specifically, process models
summarize the individual processes of organizations with their logical sequence of activities and functions, together
with involved stakeholders or exchanged data. For this reason, one of the main purposes of process models is to
communicate information and knowledge about corresponding processes. As a result, process models should be created
in a way that involved stakeholders do not encounter any challenges in the comprehension of such models in order to
take full advantage of their benefits [5].
In general, all stakeholders involved in working with process models can be assigned into a group consisting of process
modelers, process readers, or a combination of both [6]. Initially, a process modeler consolidates required information
and knowledge about a process and, hence, creates a corresponding process model based on it. Thereby, the process
modeler should be aware that the created process model reflects a high model quality in order to ensure a proper process
model comprehension [7]. Accordingly, with the assistance of the created process model, process readers are able
to extract information as well as knowledge about related processes. However, a process model of high quality that
is comprehensible for the initial model creator does not ensure that even a process reader is able to comprehend the
same model [8]. Usually, the two major reasons for this are, on one the hand, that there exists a gap of experience
and expectations (i.e., different perspectives) in working with process models [9]. On the other hand, pitfalls (e.g.,
modeling errors) in the communication of process knowledge as well as information between process modelers and
readers describe another reason [10]. To tackle these issues, specific guidelines and frameworks in literature exist
putting an emphasis on quality aspects (e.g., consistency in process models) to foster the comprehension of conceptual
as well as process models. For example, one of the most influential frameworks for conceptual modeling constitutes the
SEQUAL framework introduced in [11]. This framework considers three different quality dimensions (i.e., syntactic,
semantic, and pragmatic quality) and provides means of improvement for each quality dimensions in order to maintain
a high quality in conceptual models, thus having a positive influence on the comprehension of such models. Further, the
authors in [12] are addressing shortcomings (e.g., static view upon semantic quality) of the SEQUAL framework and
propose an adjusted framework. In addition, a significant enhancement of this work describes the consideration of as-is
as well as to-be states (i.e., domain and knowledge). Based on semiotics, an integrative framework for information
systems is discussed in [13]. Thereby, the authors consider the interaction of three worlds (i.e., material, personal, and
social) derived from Sociomateriality Theory and use this kind of interaction to discuss deficits and improvements in
model comprehension. Another framework for the evaluation of the quality and comprehension in conceptual models
constitutes the Bung-Wand-Weber (BWW) framework [14]. It comprises metrics to evaluate the quality in conceptual
models. Thereby, a focus is set on the modeling process and the BWW framework considers how objects from the
real world change during the transformation into a conceptual model and the impact on the model quality as well as
comprehension during this transformation. Moreover, the Guidelines of Modeling (GoM) describe another framework
to measure the quality in process models from different viewpoints in order to foster model comprehension [15]. In
this context, the work presented in [16] describes a set of seven process modeling guidelines (7PMG) assisting process
modelers in the creation of comprehensible models. Finally, the work presented in [17] introduces the Comprehensive
Process Model Quality Framework (CPMQF). The CPMQF summarizes existing knowledge about process model
quality and structures related knowledge based on six key questions, with an emphasis on completeness and relevance
of quality aspects in process models. However, all discussed works are mainly on a theoretical basis and none provides
an applicable measurement and the quantification of the perspectives of process modelers and readers in process
model comprehension. As a consequence, the identification of aspects in a process model that are hard to comprehend
(i.e., noise) is still tedious, because the results presented in the discussed works might be too abstract (i.e., no clear
directional guidance for process model improvement). In addition, especially novices or non-experts may find it difficult
to recognize their benefits in the context of process model comprehension.
For this reason, in line with prior conducted research and as a further contribution to improve our understanding of
working with process models, we try to foster process model comprehension with an approach that recapitulates and
quantifies the specific perspectives of process modelers and readers as well as the interaction between both groups
as main determinants in model comprehension. Therefore, this paper presents the Process Model Comprehension
Framework (PMCF). The PMCF describes the first step towards a framework to measure the comprehensibility of
process models from the perspective of process modelers, readers, and the interaction of both. Therefore, in a consensus
building process with experts from BPM and existing literature, an Evaluation Theory Tree (ETT) with 96 quality
metrics was defined. The ETT was evaluated in a survey with 131 students and practitioners to determine the importance
and degree of impact on process model comprehension of the quality criteria as well as metrics used in the ETT. In
conclusion, the PMCF quantifies process model comprehension on evaluated process models taking both the perspective
of process modelers and readers into account. To demonstrate the applicability of the PMCF, a case study with 33
participants from industry was conducted. In general, the PMCF shall unravel general pitfalls that needed to be addressed
in order to ensure a proper comprehension of process models. Furthermore, a uniform model comprehensibility is
pursued with the application of the PMCF between process modelers and readers. In the future, the PMCF is intended
to provide additional assistance for organizations in the efficient and effective utilization of information systems.

Process Model Comprehension Framework
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides theoretical fundamentals of the PMCF. The PMCF and the
defined ETT are presented in Section 3. Section 4 describes the implementation of the PMCF. In Section 5, the PMCF
is demonstrated in a case study. In addition, based on the case study, Section 5 presents how existing process models
in a practical environment can be improved in terms of process model comprehension with the PMCF. Furthermore,
current limitations as well as implications of the PMCF and future work are discussed in this section. Finally, Section 6
summarizes the paper.
2 Theoretical Fundamentals
This section introduces the underlying theoretical fundamentals of the PMCF: the Communication Theory (see Section
2.1) and the Conceptual Modeling Quality Framework (CMQF) (see Section 2.2). Figure 1 illustrates the theoretical
fundamentals with their related contribution (i.e., green), their emerging issue (i.e., red), and corresponding focus (i.e.,
blue) of the subsequent fundament.
Figure 1: Theoretical Fundamentals and their focus
2.1 Communication Theory
According to the Communication Theory (see Figure 2), a process model constitutes an artifact utilized for the
communication of information and knowledge about a process between two participants [18]. Thereby, the two
participants involved in this kind of communication can be denoted as transmitter (i.e., process modeler) and receiver
(i.e., process reader) of information and knowledge. More specifically, the process modeler encodes respective
information and knowledge about a process within a medium. In this context, the medium describes a process model.
In general, a process model delineates a conceptual model that is used to transfer information and knowledge about
a subject the model represents (e.g., order to cash process) [19]. Thereby, a process model is expressed in terms
of a particular process modeling language (e.g., Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)), which is used to
communicate information and knowledge about events, activities, decisions, data, and involved participants [20].
Thereby, a process modeling language is described by two components: (1) alphabet (i.e., set of graphemes) and (2)
grammar (i.e., systematic description of the process modeling language). Hence, it is important that a process modeler
has an adequate understanding of the alphabet and the corresponding grammar for the proper documentation of process
information and knowledge in a process model. In turn, captured information and knowledge in a process model
is decoded by a process reader. In decoding, the human perception constitutes the central information processing
system and describes the two psychological processes (a) visual perception (i.e., processing of visual information
and knowledge) and (b) comprehension (i.e., interpretation of information and knowledge). As a consequence, the
encoding as well as the decoding of information and knowledge in a process model results in different perspectives for
process modelers and readers. Consequently, pitfalls (i.e., noise) may occur between the communication of process
modelers and readers. In particularly, noise defines perturbations in the comprehension of process models. These
perturbations cause ambiguities between process modelers as well as readers regarding the communicated information
and knowledge in a process model, thus leading to a non-uniform process model comprehension. For example, the
conception of the process modeler about the process or the used modeling language for the creation of a corresponding
process model are potential noise factors in the encoding phase [21]. Regarding the process model, the intention (e.g.,
process optimization), with which the process model (e.g., textual or visual) is perceived, denotes another noise factor
[22]. Finally, reasons for noise in the decoding phase are mainly the perceptual as well as cognitive processing (e.g.,
expertise in working with process models) of information and knowledge in the process model [23]. Generally, the
occurrence of noise in this context depends on many additional factors [24, 25, 9].
3
Process Model Comprehension Framework
A significant reason for the occurrence of noise between the three aspects encoding, process model, and decoding is
mainly due to the lack of the overall process model quality in this communication procedure [26]. Thereby, quality
defines characteristics aspects (e.g., process modeling expertise, correctness of a process model) that can be measured
and compared with each other (e.g., degree of excellence) [27]. In this context, the Conceptual Modeling Quality
Framework (CMQF), therefore, defines a set of quality aspects in order to prevent noise and, at the same time, to assure
a high quality in the creation and comprehension of conceptual models (e.g., process model).
Figure 2: Communication Theory
2.2 Conceptual Modeling Quality Framework
The Conceptual Modeling Quality Framework (CMQF) presents a unified overview considering the quality of the
conceptual modeling process as well as the quality of the corresponding final result (i.e., conceptual model) [28]. Figure
3 presents the CMQF with corresponding clusters, dimensions, and layers with related quality types (i.e., physical: red,
knowledge: green, learning: purple, development: blue). In general, the CMQF addresses figuratively occurring noise
known from the Communication Theory (see Section 2.1) without having a concrete perspective of a process modeler
nor a reader. Importantly, the CMQF defines two horizontal clusters describing the physical (i.e., real world) and the
cognitive reality (i.e., cognitive perception). The physical reality refers to the domain of discourse [29], whereas the
cognitive reality describes the constructed representation of the perception from the real world. Moreover, for each
horizontal cluster, the CMQF defines four vertical clusters: domain, model, language, and representation. These four
vertical clusters represent the conceptual modeling process. In particular, the domain refers to the process environment,
which can be depicted in a conceptual model. The conceptual model, in turn, is created in terms of a particular modeling
language resulting in a specific representation of the conceptual model. Moreover, all clusters comprise eight different
quality dimensions. These eight quality dimensions constitute either physical or cognitive artifacts in conceptual
modeling. Moreover, the quality dimensions are associated with quality types, summarized in four different layers: the
physical (see Figure 3, red), knowledge (see Figure 3, green), learning (see Figure 3, purple), and development (see
Figure 3, blue) layer. In the physical layer, the appropriateness of a conceptual model for the depiction of a process and
its environment is evaluated. The knowledge layer states that for each physical representation a cognitive equivalent
representation in the perception exists. Furthermore, the learning layer explains how information and knowledge
are acquired by the interpretation of the real world. Finally, the development layer describes that knowledge and
information are used in the creation of physical artifacts (e.g., conceptual model). The quality types define for each
layer the relationship between a reference and a purpose of application. More specifically, the reference constitutes the
chosen quality dimension, whereas the purpose of application depicts the quality dimension that is being considered
across all quality dimensions. Moreover, to draw on the Communication Theory, the quality types are responsible for
the prevention of noise. For example, the quality aspect between the physical domain (i.e., reference) and the domain
knowledge (i.e., purpose of application) depends strongly on the perception of a person. Hence, it is of importance to
ensure that the person has a correct understanding of the domain. The four layers as well as the quality types (i.e., seven
in physical, seven in learning, four in learning, and six in development) depict the conceptual modeling process and, at
the same time, preserve the completeness as well as the correctness of the final conceptual model.

Process Model Comprehension Framework
Figure 3: Conceptual Modeling Quality Framework (CMQF)
3 Process Model Comprehension Framework
The Process Model Comprehension Framework (PMCF) is an adaption of the CMQF and considers the comprehension
of process models based on the fundamentals of the Communication Theory (see Section 2). The PMCF allows for
the measurement of the perspectives of process modelers and readers as well as the interaction between both as main
determinants in the context of process model comprehension. As novelty, the PMCF is capable to quantify process
model comprehension for different perspectives (i.e., process modelers and readers) and facilitates the identification of
noise in model comprehension. Figure 4 delineates the PMCF. As known from the CMQF (see Fig. 3), the two vertical
clusters (i.e., physical and cognitive reality), the four layers (physical (P1 - 7, red), knowledge (K1 - 7, green), learning
(L1 - 4, purple), and development (D1 - 6, blue) remain unchanged in the PMCF. The four vertical clusters (i.e., domain,
model, language, and representation), the inherent eight quality dimensions as well as the associated quality types have
been adapted accordingly to fit to the requirements concerning process models. The first vertical cluster refers to the
process and its environment as well as the process knowledge thereof. The second cluster, in turn, considers the process
model and related model knowledge. Similarly as in the second cluster, the third cluster correlates the used process
modeling language with respective knowledge. Finally, the fourth cluster describes the representation of the process
in the real world and in the perception. In the PMCF, the same quality types from the CMQF are used, but are not
considered as unidirectional relationships. Instead, the relationships between the quality types are bidirectional. The
reason is that a quality type between two dimensions, on the one hand, leads to knowledge gain and, on the other hand,
indicates the necessary knowledge level to assure a high model quality. For example, consider the quality type K1
in Fig. 4, this quality type between the Process Domain Knowledge (i.e., reference) and Process Model Knowledge
(i.e., purpose of application) addresses the fact that describes which knowledge level about the process is required
(e.g., information about value-adding activities) to represent this process in a process model. On the contrary, changing
reference with purpose of application, describes that the comprehension of a process model consequently results in new
insights (e.g., identification of bottlenecks) about the process.
3.1 Evaluation Theory Tree (ETT)
Based on the fundamentals discussed, an Evaluation Theory Tree (ETT) was defined [30]. In general, the ETT represents
a convolution of the PMCF. Hence, the roots of the ETT consider the perspectives of the process modelers and readers.
The reason for two roots in the ETT is due to the fact that aspects exist that cannot be mapped directly between both
perspectives. For example, the creation of a process model is only relevant for process modelers. Therefore, process
modelers and readers must be considered separately. Each perspective, in turn, consists of a number of aggregated
quality criteria in the context of process model comprehension. These quality criteria are related to the eight quality
dimensions from the PMCF (see Figure 4). Furthermore, the quality criteria and metrics were obtained from existing
literature in a related review as well as from conducted interviews with domain experts from the field of BPM.
Literature review: In literature, there exists numerous works focusing on process model quality in order to, on one the
hand, improve the creation and, on the other hand, to foster the comprehension of process models [9, 31]. Moreover,
different frameworks as well as guidelines with an emphasis on process model quality were defined for this context
as well (see Section 1). Regarding the PMCF, several data sources and publication libraries (e.g., Google Scholar,
SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore Digital Library) were examined for works concerning process model quality during process
5
Process Model Comprehension Framework
Figure 4: Process Model Comprehension Framework (PMCF)
model creation and comprehension. Therefore, search strings were elaborated with the combinations of keywords
derived from our knowledge of the subject focus (e.g., process model quality).
Interviews: In the conducted interviews, eight domain experts (i.e., from academia and industry) with many years of
expertise in the field of BPM were personally consulted. The used catalog of questions contained a set of opinion (e.g.,
Which quality aspects in a process model are essential in the creation of a complete and correct process documentation,
but also to ensure that the created model can be comprehended by all involved stakeholders?), behavioral (e.g., How
can it be avoided that a process modeler creates an incorrect model?), and competency (e.g., When does the application
of a process modeling language or the creation/comprehension of a process model become too complex?) questions in
terms of preservation of quality in process modeling as well as process model comprehension. From the given answers
of the interviewed domain experts, quality criteria and metrics were identified referring on the perspective of process
modelers, readers, and synergies covering both perspectives.
The categorization of the quality criteria and corresponding metrics were done within a consensus decision-making
process, involving participants from industry and academia as well as obtained insights from the literature review,
including the interviews.
As a result, the perspective of process modeler comprises the following six main quality criteria:
• Process Modeling Language: This criterion covers crucial aspects (e.g., workflow patterns) that a process
model language should support for the creation of high quality process models.
• Process Modeling Tool: The quality of created process models are dependent of the used process modeling tool.
Hence, this criterion summarizes vital aspects (e.g., process views) about tool-support in process modeling.
• Information: This criterion is concerned with process information retrieval and addresses aspects like correct-
ness and completeness of process information.
• Errors: Semantic (e.g., logical errors) and syntactic (e.g., errors in modeling conventions) errors in a process
model are subject of this criterion.
• Person: Person-related characteristics (e.g., process modeling experience) are considered in this criterion.
• Process Modeling Guidelines: This criterion covers guidelines and rules (i.e., from enterprise and academic)
that were defined in order to create process models of high quality.
These quality criteria are subdivided into several sub-metrics, resulting in 54 different quality metrics.
Regarding the perspective of process reader, 42 quality metrics are summarized in a total of seven main quality criteria,
which are defined as follows:
• Process Modeling Language: This criterion addresses aspects (e.g., modeling language complexity) that define
comprehensible process modeling language.
• Medium: The subject of this criterion is the question with which medium (e.g., paper-based) is the process
model comprehended.
• Information: This criterion deals about which kind of process information (e.g., process participants) are
included in the process model.
6
Process Model Comprehension Framework
• Person: Person-related characteristics (e.g., process modeling experience) are considered in this criterion.
• Level of Detail: In this criterion, the level of detail (e.g., abstract or concrete) of the comprehended process
model is addressed.
• Representation Factors: Aspects about the process model representation (e.g., number of elements) and the
model structure (e.g., block structure) are subject of this criterion.
• Comprehension Questions: Process model comprehension performance analysis (e.g., comprehension ques-
tions) are considered in this criterion.
Altogether, the ETT contains 96 quality metrics. Each of the 96 metrics can be assigned to one or more quality types in
the PMCF (e.g., learnability of a modeling language refers to K1 in Figure 4). Further, the evaluation of the quality
types facilitates the identification of noise (e.g., difference in process model knowledge) between process modelers and
readers as known from the PMCF. Due to space limitations, Figure 5 only presents an excerpt of the ETT (see Appendix
A).
Figure 5: Excerpt from the ETT
In order to measure and quantify process model comprehension, the importance and the impact on process model
comprehension for each quality criterion and its related metric in the ETT had to be determined. For example, as
shown in [32], the number of elements in a process model constitutes a more critical factor having a stronger impact on
process model comprehension juxtaposed to the labeling of process model elements. For this reason, a survey with 131
participants from academia as well as industry was conducted. The participants of the survey were asked to rate and
place the quality criteria as well as related metrics for both considered perspectives (i.e., process modeler and reader) in
an order from important to unimportant to determine the rank and the impact of each quality criterion and metric. For
the determination of the rank, the results were analyzed with the weighted arithmetic mean X̄ that is defined as follows:
X̄ =
Pn
k=1 wkpi,k
Pn
k=1 wk
, (1)
where k is the rank, n is the number of ranks, wk is the weighting factor for the rank k, i is the quality metric, and pi,k
is the percentage choice of the quality metric i on the rank k.
The weighting factor wk had to be determined, since each quality criterion and related metric exert a different impact
on process model comprehension. For the calculation of the weighting factor wk, the following evaluation methods
for information retrieval were juxtaposed in a series of repeated measurements: Rank Sum, Reciprocal Rank, Rank
Exponent, Discounted Cumulative Gain, and Distance Normalized Logarithm [33]. Most considered methods showed
a disparate differentiation between the quality criteria and metrics (i.e., Rank Sum, Rank Exponent, Discounted
Cumulative Gain). Moreover, the methods presented no standardized distance between the highest and the lowest rank
as well the ranks in between. In more detail, the provided weighting factors of those methods exhibited a limited growth
leading to an incorrect differentiation of the quality criteria and metrics. However, further analyses demonstrated that
a cubic (i.e., Reciprocal Rank) or an exponential growth (i.e., Distance Normalized Logarithm (DNLog)) should be
considered in this context. A comparison of both methods revealed that the DNLog was more suitable for our purpose.
The reason for this decision was that the DNLog ensures a more detailed weighting of the quality criteria as well as
metrics. For example, a vital criterion or metric (e.g., syntactical process model correctness [34]) has a more significant
impact on process model comprehension and should be given a greater weight compared to negligible ones (e.g., avoid
7
Process Model Comprehension Framework
OR routing process model elements [16]). As a result, the DNLog was chosen for the calculation of the weighting
factor wk, which is defined as:
wk = 10(n−k)
log10(d)
(n−1) , (2)
where n is the number of items, k is the rank, and d is the score in the survey.
Equations (1) and (2) were used to analyze the responses from the 131 participants of the survey and to determine the
rank as well as the impact of all quality criteria and related metrics on process model comprehension for the perspective
of process modelers, readers, and the interaction between both perspectives.
4 Implementation of the Process Model Comprehension Framework
This section presents how the PMCF is implemented in order to measure and quantify process model comprehension.
For this purpose, the ETT has been implemented in a Microsoft Excel workbook template (see Appendix B). According
to the Communication Theory, this workbook is used to evaluate process models regarding their comprehensibility to
unravel noise between the communication of process modelers and readers. Note that the workbook consists of nine
sheets:
1 Configuration 2 Process Modeling Language Complexity
3 Supported Patterns 4 Quality Metrics
5 Questionnaire for Process Modeler 6 Questionnaire for Process Reader
7 Perspective of Process Modeler 8 Perspective of Process Reader
9 Summary
The workbook supports the evaluation of process models expressed in terms of the following process modeling
languages: Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) 2.0, Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs), and UML
Activity Diagrams. Since the relevant sheets are predefined with the results obtained from the survey (i.e., weighting of
the quality criteria and metrics), only the sheets (4), (5), and (6) must be completed to quantify the perspectives (i.e.,
process modeler, reader, and both) in the context of process model comprehension. Changes in the remaining sheets are
only necessary if factors (e.g., weighting factor wk) shall be adjusted, further quality criteria and metrics need to be
introduced, or the workbook shall be extended to support additional modeling languages. Regarding the latter, in all
sheets, respective information for the newly introduced modeling language must be added.
(1) Configuration: Process modeling languages have various impact on process model comprehension (e.g., in terms
of expressiveness) [6]. Thus, the operationalization thereof is performed in the workbook in (2). Moreover, with respect
to comparability, all results in the workbook are normalized within an interval between [1, 10]. Thereby, a 1 represents a
worse outcome, whereas a 10 indicates the best outcome regarding process model comprehension. Hence, in this sheet,
the complexity coefficient kCik calculated in (2) (see Equation (5)) is normalized to C̄i for each process modeling
language within an interval between [1, 10], and is defined as follows:
C̄i = 10 −
(10 ∗ kCik) − kCik
MAX(Cn) ∗ 10
, (3)
where i is the process modeling language, kCik is the complexity score for the specific process modeling language i,
and Cn is the set of all complexity scores.
Another factor having an impact on process model comprehension is the use of workflow patterns in a process model.
These patterns play a crucial role in the creation of such models and are, therefore, especially for process modelers of
importance [35]. The impact of workflow patterns, (i.e., Pi calculated in (3), currently just for control flow patterns) is
shown in this sheet and is included in the determination of the process model comprehension score for the perspective
of process modelers (see (7)).
(2) Process Modeling Language Complexity: In general, a process modeling language is composed of a number of
modeling elements, their characteristics (e.g., different activity types), and their relations (e.g., different flow types such
as sequence or data), which define the expressiveness of respective language [36]. Based on this consideration, the
workbook defines the complexity of a process modeling language Ci as a three-dimensional vector:
Ci = (xi, yi, zi), (4)
8
Process Model Comprehension Framework
where i is the process modeling language, xi is the number of elements of the modeling language, yi is the number of
characteristics per element, and zi is the number of relationships per element [37].
Accordingly, the number of elements, their characteristics as well as their relations reflect the complexity of a modeling
language. With the Euclidean norm, Ci can be converted to the complexity score kCik for a specific process modeling
language i:
kCik =
q
x2
i + y2
i + z2
i (5)
(3) Supported Patterns: The expressiveness as well as suitability of a process modeling language is not only determined
by the number of elements, their characteristics, and their relations (see (2)), but also by the number of supported
workflow patterns [35]. Workflow patterns describe specific mechanisms supporting stakeholders dealing with the
complexity of process models (e.g., consideration of different perspectives such as control flow and data). For this
reason, [38] defined a set of workflow patterns, which are considered in the workbook. In this context, the workbook
supports the following workflow pattern types: control flow, data, and resource patterns. Furthermore, for each workflow
pattern type, the workbook considers which workflow patterns are fully, partially, or not supported in the respective
modeling language. Based on this consideration, the score for supported patterns Pi is determined as follows:
Pi = mi + ni + oi, (6)
where i is the process modeling language, mi is the number of fully and partially supported control flow patterns, ni is
the number of fully and partially supported data patterns, and oi is the number of fully and partially supported resource
patterns.
Pi (in percentage, currently just for control flows patterns) is used in (1) for the determination of the process model
comprehension score pertaining to the perspective of process modelers (see (7)).
(4) Quality Metrics: In this sheet, for the perspective of process modelers and readers, the quality metrics from the
PMCF (i.e., ETT) related to the evaluated process model are determined. In particular, for each quality metric, an
explanation of the respective metric is given as well as an instruction on how to determine the corresponding metric
(e.g., number of in-/outgoing edges per process modeling element). The metrics are determined either as described in
respective literature or must be determined manually considering the process model to be evaluated. If the determined
result has not yet been normalized, the result will be normalized in an additional step within an interval between [1, 10].
Thereby, a result towards the right boundary (i.e., 10) describes a more positive impact on the comprehension of the
process model.
(5) Questionnaire for Process Modeler: The comprehension of a process model depends not only on factors of the
respective process model (e.g., size of the process model), but also on the perception of the original creator (i.e.,
process modeler) of the model. Thereby, a process modeler has personal related characteristics (e.g., expertise in
process modeling) in the context of process modeling as well as an individual interpretation about the information and
knowledge regarding the process and its related model. Furthermore, there exist a specific mental interpretation about
the process and resulting process model in the mind of the process modeler. As described in Section 2.1, noise may
occur in the communication of process information and knowledge between the process modeler as well as readers.
For this reason, it is important to capture and know both personal related characteristics as well as the interpretation
of the process modeler (i.e., perspective of process modelers) to identify respective noise and to initiate countersteps.
Therefore, the original process modeler of a corresponding model has to answer a specific questionnaire capturing
personal related characteristics as well as the related interpretation of the process and its resulting process model. The
questionnaire consists of a set of 49 different questions addressing quality criteria and metrics from the ETT to capture
the perspective of the process modeler. The questions types are a set of true-or-false and Likert scale questions. The
responses are compiled to a score within the interval [1, 10], whereas ten indicates a more positive impact on process
model comprehension.
(6) Questionnaire for Process Reader: Similar to the process modeler, a specific questionnaire to capture the
perspective of process readers has to be answered. This questionnaire consists of 24 questions related to corresponding
quality criteria as well as metrics from the ETT in order to gather the perception and interpretation of process readers
about the comprehended process model. Equally to (5), the responses reflect a score within the interval [1, 10], whereas
ten constitutes the best score regarding process model comprehension.
(7) Perspective of Process Modeler: This sheet contains all the ranked as well as weighted quality criteria and
corresponding metrics from the ETT for process modelers. The individual scores are automatically generated based on
the results obtained from the sheets (1), (4), and (5). Hence, this sheet requires no interaction and is used exclusively
9
Process Model Comprehension Framework
for aggregating and calculating the process model comprehension score for process modelers. Therefore, as a first step,
the sum of all quality metrics Qc of the respective criterion is calculated:
Qc =
n
X
i=1
i, (7)
where c is the quality criterion, i is the quality metric, and n is the number of quality metrics.
The final process model comprehension score for process modelers Sm, which represents a score within the interval
[1, 10] (i.e., ten is the best), is built from the sum of all aggregated quality criterion Qc:
Sm =
6
X
c=1
= Qc (8)
Based on Qc, possible factors for noise can be identified by considering related quality metrics with a score towards the
left boundary within the interval [1, 10] (see Section 5).
(8) Perspective of Process Reader: Similar to (7), the process model comprehension score for process readers Sr is
determined in this sheet. Hence, all ranked as well as weighted quality criteria and corresponding metrics from the ETT
are shown here. The determination of the score is carried out in the same way as described in (7), only with relevant
aspects for process readers. Therefore, no changes are required in this sheet. The process model comprehension score
for process readers reflects a score within the interval [1, 10] (i.e., ten is the best), based on the sum of the aggregated
quality criteria for process readers. As with the process modeler, factors for noise in the comprehension of a process
model can be identified on the basis of the individual calculated scores for respective quality criterion and related
metrics (see Section 5).
(9) Summary: The final sheet in the workbook presents the quantified process model comprehension scores on the
evaluated process model. Here, the scores for the perspective of process modelers Sm and readers Sr as well as the
interaction of both Sb are presented. The single scores are within the interval [1, 10], whereas 1 indicates the worst
score regarding process model comprehension and 10 the best. Thereby, the scores for process modelers and readers are
determined in the sheets (7) and (8), respectively. The score for the interaction of both perspectives Sb is determined as
follows:
Sb = (wm ∗ Sm) + (wr ∗ Sr), (9)
where wm is the weight for process modelers and wr is the weight for process readers.
The two weights wm and wr were determined within the survey with the specific question asking about which aspect in
a process model is considered to be more significant, i.e., ease of creation (wm) or ensuring proper comprehensibility
(wr). Hence, the percentage distribution was calculated from the responses given.
5 Case Study and Application of the Process Model Comprehension Framework
In order to demonstrate the applicability of the PMCF (i.e., workbook), a case study with 33 participants from industry
was conducted (see Appendix C). According to collected demographic data, all participants stated that they already
had been working with process models. Hence, the experience in process modeling as well as model comprehension
was between a novice and intermediate level. The participants were asked to comprehend five real-world scenarios
from a business consultant company. Each scenario was documented in two different process model variants (i.e.,
ten in total), with a respective emphasis on the following process modeling aspects: start events, end events, loops,
parallelism, and decomposition. In one variant, mentioned aspects were explicitly documented in a process model, while
in the other models, they were only implicitly (i.e., described in an activity) documented. In addition, for each process
model, participants needed to answer a set of four true-or-false comprehension questions about semantic aspects in the
models. Regarding the PMCF, the workbook sheets (4) Quality Metrics, (5) Questionnaire for Process Modeler, and (6)
Questionnaire for Process Reader were completed accordingly. Thereby, the sheet (4) was completed by considering the
characteristics of the process models (e.g., number of modeling elements). The sheet (5) was answered by the original
creator of the process models. Thereby, there was only one original creator for each process model. Finally, the sheet
(6) was answered by the 33 participants of the study after each comprehended process model. Table 1 presents the
results from the case study. In detail, the table shows, for each process model and respective variant, the mean of the
10

results from the comprehension questions (i.e., max is four) as well as the determined process model comprehension
scores with the workbook for the process modeler, reader (i.e., average), and both (i.e., average).

Note: Perspective scores range within the interval [1, 10], whereas ten
indicates the best score regarding process model comprehension
According to the results from the comprehension questions, the variants with explicitly documented process modeling
aspects had a more positive impact on process model comprehension (i.e., higher comprehension scores). Considering
both perspectives, in general, the process model comprehension scores mainly confirm this observation (i.e., higher
perspective scores). Only for the second implicit process model (i.e., end event) variant, the score is slightly higher.
Consider Table 1, there are only small differences in the comprehension scores between the perspectives, compared
to the differences in the comprehension questions. A reason is that the use of questions represents a simple metric,
which is susceptible to deviations (e.g., guessing or heterogeneous distribution of expertise). The PMCF, in turn, not
only considers the performance in model comprehension (i.e., answering of the questions), but also a variety of quality
metrics, which each have a different strong impact on process model comprehension, leading to a more fine-grained
result. Furthermore, which is not apparent from the consideration of the comprehension question results only, there are
differences between the process modelers and readers. Regarding the process readers, the PMCF workbook results
in a comprehension score of about 6. Since the comprehension score is within the interval [1, 10] (i.e., 10 is the
best), it indicates that the process models are slightly above the average in terms of process model comprehension.
Furthermore, it is remarkable that the original creator of the process models evaluated their own created process
models as less comprehensible in the retrospect compared to respective readers. The comprehension scores for process
modelers are approximately between 4 and 6. A reason could be that the process modelers during the answering of the
PMCF worksheet (5) Questionnaire for Process Modeler have critically recapitulated their own process model. More
specifically, single items from the PMCF worksheet (5) (e.g., knowledge about process domain, correctness of process
information) may had drawn attention to possible deficits in the process model. Since process modelers and readers
have different perspectives, a uniform comprehension of the process models used in the study was not given, due to
occurring noise in the communication of process information and knowledge.
5.1 Application of the Process Model Comprehension Framework
The PMCF allows for the identification of reasons for difficulties as well as noise (e.g., discrepancies in process
domain knowledge) during the comprehension of the presented process models in order to initiate steps to improve
respective models. Therefore, the workbook sheets (7) Perspective of Process Modeler and (8) Perspective of Process
Reader may be considered. As described in Section 4, these sheets are aggregating and calculating the process model
comprehension scores for respective perspectives. For this purpose, the sum of all quality metrics for each quality
criterion are calculated (i.e., six for process modeler and seven for process reader; see Section 4). Afterwards, the final
comprehension score is determined from the sum of the aggregated quality criteria and compiled to a score within the
interval [1, 10], whereas 10 indicates the best score regarding process model comprehension. In the optimum case, the
final comprehension score is 10, which means that the quality criteria and metrics have also been aggregated to a value
of 10.
In the following, an example is presented how the insights from the PMCF worksheets may be used in order to foster
11
Process Model Comprehension Framework
process model comprehension. Therefore, the results regarding the third process model (i.e., explicit loop) from the
process modeler and a reader are considered (see Appendix D).
Perspective of Process Modeler: Considering the individual scores we obtained from the case study, for example, we
noticed for the perspective of the process modeler that the score regarding the quality criterion Information (see Section
3) is 5.01. Thereby, the quality criterion Information is concerned with process information retrieval and consists
of the following metrics: completeness (i.e., Is the process information complete?), correctness (i.e., Is the process
information correct?), availability (i.e., What availability does the process information have?), and method (i.e., Which
methods are available for process information retrieval?). Regarding the two latter metrics, in our example, the score is
2.1 for availability and 1.6 for method. As a direct consequence, the original process modeler had difficulties with the
availability of process information (i.e., only textual process documentations were available) as well as in the choice
of methods for process information retrieval (i.e., only the study of the textual process information was available).
Therefore, an increase in the availability of process information and methods for information retrieval would, on the
one hand, lead to the creation of a better comprehensible process model because process information can be collected
more effectively. On the other hand, as a result, an increase in these two metrics would have a positive effect on the
score regarding the quality criterion Information, thus leading to an increase in the final process model comprehension
score for the process modeler, reader and the interaction between both perspectives.
Perspective of Process Reader: Considering the perspective of process readers and their individual scores obtained
from the case study, for example, the score regarding the quality criterion Person (see Section 3) is 5.34 in our example.
In more detail, the process model readers have stated that their experience of working with process models (e.g., number
of analyzed process models) is maximum at the level of an intermediate. Moreover, contemplating the quality criterion
Representation Factors and related metrics that are concerned with structural factors of the process models (e.g., block
structure), the score is 3.68. These scores provide us with indications about how to increase the final comprehension
score for the perspective of process reader. On the one hand, process readers should be more concerned with different
kind of process models in order to increase their experience in working with such models. Further, on the other, the
used process models in the study could be adjusted by respecting a consistent block structure. These steps would then
have a positive impact on the final comprehension score of process readers but also on the comprehension score of
process modeler as well as the interaction between both.
In summary, the conducted case study demonstrated the successful application of the PMCF in a practical environment.
The results indicated that there is a non-uniform comprehension of process models between process modelers and
readers. Moreover, the PMCF revealed that process modelers and readers are confronted with different challenges
(i.e., noise) in process model comprehension. In general, although the PMCF is still in the early stage of development,
it can already be applied on real-world process models of organizations for identifying potentials for process model
improvements, i.e., in order to prevent noise in the communication of process information and knowledge, thus fostering
the general comprehension of such models.
5.2 Limitations
Although the PMCF is still applicable in practical environments, it is noteworthy that it is still in an early stage of
development and that the PMCF is a first step towards measuring and quantifying process model comprehension. Hence,
the PMCF as well as the developed workbook are currently confronted with limitations that need to be discussed and
will be subject of future work. First, the interpretation of the calculated process model comprehension scores must
be evaluated. In detail, the results range in the interval between [1, 10], whereas 10 indicates the best score regarding
process model comprehension. The first applications of the workbook demonstrated that the calculated scores are
reliable (see Section 5). However, the workbook must be applied on many more process models in order to be able
to interpret differences in the scores accurately and to define a score threshold, from which process models are well
comprehensible for the general public. Second, the use of the DNLog in order to determine the weights (i.e., wk) for
the quality criteria as well as metrics should be further evaluated. Third, the normalization of the results from the
quality criteria and related metrics as well as the meaningful applicability of the normalization approach need to be
further evaluated as well. Fourth, in general, the completeness, accuracy, and validity of the PMCF as well as the
workbook need to be scrutinized in detail as the PMCF contains a great number of quality criteria and metrics. These
quality aspects are derived from the process of adaption of the CMQF, a literature review, and conducted interviews.
However, myriads of quality aspects exist that currently do not fall within the scope of the PMCF [31, 39]. These
include, in particular, cognitive aspects, which, as known from recent studies in this context, exert a significant impact
on the comprehension of process models [10, 40]. Moreover, cognitive aspects may be the critical mediator in the
communication of process information as well as knowledge between process modelers and readers.
12
Process Model Comprehension Framework
5.3 Implications
With this paper, we highlight the important implications of the PMCF and the ability to measure and to quantify
process model comprehension for practice. Process models constitute vital artifacts in the application of information
technologies (e.g., PAIS). In particular, during the utilization of information systems, undiscovered errors made (e.g.,
incorrect process documentation due to noise in the communication of process information and knowledge) may have
critical impacts in the later utilization and, hence, projects might not deliver the required results or even fail. For
this reason, it is of importance that process models are created correctly as well as accurately. At the same time, it
should be ensured that these models are comprehensible for all involved stakeholders. In this context, a process model
is an artifact used for the communication of process information and knowledge between participants (see Section
2.1). During this kind of communication, noise may occur that may impairs the comprehension of process models.
Therefore, during process model comprehension, the PMCF allows for the measurement and quantification of the
perspectives of process modelers, readers, and the interaction between both. This allows for the identification of noise,
which could therefore be addressed ensuring a proper process model comprehension. Moreover, since the PMCF covers
different quality criteria and metrics covering various aspects (e.g., process modeling tools, medium (see Section 3.1))
for respective perspectives, organizations are able to identify concrete deficiencies in the context of process models with
the provided scores of the PMCF. Further, despite the preliminary focus on the comprehension of process models, the
insights obtained with the PMCF also affect the creation of process models (see Section 5.4). Thus, in the creation or
optimization of process models, factors for noise in the communication of process information and knowledge can be
avoided paving the way for process models of high quality. With the support and extensibility of additional process
modeling languages, the PMCF assists organizations in the selection of an appropriate modeling language. This is
applicable when a process modeling language is selected for the first time (e.g., in the early phases of the information
systems development process), or in case of a modeling language change, which is, for example, pursued due to a
process model redesign.
5.4 Future Work
The used approach of definition for the PMCF allows for an appropriate extensibility. More specifically, novel quality
criteria or metrics can be added to the ETT. Therefore, to address the discussed limitations (see Section 5.2), the
PMCF is currently used in ongoing studies that evaluate different process models from theory as well as practice
with heterogeneous participant groups. The objective is, on the one hand, to improve our general interpretation of
the calculated process model comprehension scores and, on the other hand, to identify additional noise factors in the
communication of process knowledge and information between process modeler as well as reader. The unraveled
insights allow for the definition of directives towards creating better comprehensible process models with high quality.
In this context, the results for the different perspectives obtained from the PMCF are juxtaposed with existing rules
and guidelines (e.g., Guidelines of Modeling [15], Seven Process Modeling Guidelines [16], which are intended to
ensure a proper comprehension of process models, in order to evaluate their contribution regarding process model
comprehension. Moreover, the weighting factor wk is examined in detail and will be adjusted as well as refined
accordingly when, for example, new quality criteria and metrics are added. In addition, other approaches, in addition
to the already evaluated one (see Section 3) to determine the weighting factor wk are juxtaposed to the DNLog in
order to evaluate their appropriateness. Furthermore, the PMCF will be extended and enriched with further quality
criteria and metrics to obtain more fine-grained scores. In this context, we are currently augmenting the PMCF with
additional criteria and metrics to include the creation of process models (i.e., process of process modeling) [41]. This
augmentation should ensure that process models are created in a high quality and in a comprehensible form from the
very beginning and, thus, should prevent the occurrence of noise in the communication of process knowledge as well
as information. Support for additional process modeling languages and workflow patterns are subject of future work.
Finally, to pave the way for cognitive aspects, the PMCF will be integrated into the conceptual framework of the authors
that incorporates concepts from cognitive neuroscience and psychology introduced in [42].
6 Conclusion
This paper presented the Process Model Comprehension Framework (PMCF) as a first step towards measuring and
quantifying the comprehensibility of process models. Based on the Communication Theory and the CMQF, the PMCF
considers the perspectives of process modelers and readers as well as the interaction between them as main determinants
in process model comprehension. Therefore, in order to identify and prevent noise (i.e., misinterpretation in the
communication of process information and knowledge due to person- and model-related characteristics) in model
comprehension, an ETT was defined composed of a set of quality criteria and 96 metrics in total. Thereby, the quality
criteria and related metrics were obtained from interviews with experts in the field of Business Process Management and
in a literature review. Further, these quality aspects are ranked and weighted with regard to their importance and impact
13
Process Model Comprehension Framework
on process model comprehension in a survey with 131 participants from academia and industry. The ETT and the
results from the survey have been implemented in an Excel workbook, which allows to measure and quantify process
model comprehension on existing process models. The application of the workbook and how to improve process
models based on the results obtained was demonstrated successfully in a case study with 33 participants from industry.
Accordingly, the PMCF and its corresponding workbook shall contribute to identify and avoid pitfalls (i.e., noise) in the
communication of process knowledge and information between process modelers and readers. In addition, the PMCF
wants to ensure that process models implemented in information systems are of high quality for the purpose of a proper
model comprehensibility. Therefore, the calculated process model comprehension scores with the PMCF and related
workbook serve as a signpost in order to foster and ensure a correct comprehension of process models. Further, the
initial creation of comprehensible process models or the optimization of existing models is supported by the PMCF. In
general, the PMCF and the future work thereof shall assist organizations in all phases (i.e., design, implementation, and
management) in the utilization of information systems.
