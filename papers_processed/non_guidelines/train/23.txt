ABSTRACT
The word “robot” frequently conjures unrealistic
expectations of utilitarian perfection: tireless, efficient,
and flawless agents. However, real-world robots are
far from perfect—they fail and make mistakes. Thus,
roboticists should consider altering their current
assumptions and cultivating new perspectives that
account for a more complete range of robot roles,
behaviors, and interactions. To encourage this, we
explore the use of metaphors for generating novel
ideas and reframing existing problems, eliciting new
perspectives of human-robot interaction. Our work
makes two contributions. We (1) surface current
assumptions that accompany the term “robots,” and
(2) present a collection of alternative perspectives
of interaction with robots through metaphors. By
identifying assumptions, we provide a comprehensible
list of aspects to reconsider regarding robots’physicality,
roles, and behaviors. Through metaphors, we propose
new ways of examining how we can use, relate to, and
co-exist with the robots that will share our future.

INTRODUCTION
Human-robot interaction (HRI) offers fertile ground
for interaction design research. Defined as a field
dedicated to ‘understanding, designing, and evaluating
robotic systems for use by or with humans’ [24], HRI
is increasingly engaged in investigating interactions
not only in computational terms, but in terms of the
social, cultural, and ethical implications of what a robot
is, the purpose it serves, and its intended behavior [4].
Conducting robotic design research poses a unique
challenge for human-computer interaction and other
design fields as it is one of the few novel interfaces
with a long history of pre-existing assumptions strongly
linked to the word “robot.” Etymologically, “robot”
denotes slavery or forced labor, notions that persist to
modern times [51].
Over the last decade, the field of HRI has witnessed
the growing use of design methods and approaches
that stem from human-centered design considerations
(see the dedicated workshop [19], to HRI evaluation
methods like the USUS [62]), to speculative and critical
design explorations (e.g., [4, 12]). These methods help
researchers address robotic projects more holistically,
by understanding the needs of potential users and
implications of specific contexts [6]. Interaction
design explorations, then, not only contribute to the
development of form, function, and desired effects of
robots, but they also invite researchers to reflect on the
philosophical, ethical, and political implications that
specific robot designs and projects might entail [6].
As designers engaged in HRI work, we posit that the
field suffers from some fixed thinking about what a robot
is and what functions it should serve. Dominant are the
ideas of robots as lifelike [7] and fully autonomous
agents [8]; notions of robot utility [50], efficiency [57]
and predictability [20]; and the overall misconception
that robot behaviors must always be positive. Fixation
is described as an ‘effect in which an individual might
unconsciously focus on certain aspects of an object or
a task, whilst leaving others aside’ [59]; in the specific
case of design practices, fixated thinking has been
demonstrated when lead designers blindly adhere to a
limited set of ideas in the design process [30]. Similarly,
fixation in HRI stands in the way of alternative
approaches to robot design [4], obscuring the values that
could meaningfully inspire and guide our understanding
of future human-robot relationships.
In the design field, the problem of fixation is not new, as
testified by a vast literature dedicated to understanding
the topic and proposing ways to tackle it [16, 44, 54, 61,
64]. Among these, the use of metaphors is increasingly
acknowledged as a powerful strategy to deal with fixation
since they let us break assumptions that stem creative
thinking [10, 11, 13, 14, 32, 36, 46, 55]. Metaphors are
a way to think and talk about one kind of thing in terms
of another [35]. For example, the metaphor ‘a robot is
a servant’ frames a robot as a submissive entity that
performs duties for its owner. As such, metaphors affect
how we think and approach problems and products and
are not limited to being mere figures of speech. They
can inform design decisions [29] and highlight different
aspects of a complex concept like a robot, from details
of interfaces (e.g., ‘a sad robot is blue’ [39]) to wider
societal images of the technology (e.g., ‘a robot is a
human’ [5]).
Current dominant assumptions in HRI either
conceptualize the robot as a mechanical tool to be
operated or as a ‘being,’ taking as reference the
interaction with other humans or pets [38]. While
undoubtedly having advantages, these approaches
nonetheless hinder meaningful explorations of what
might be non-human/pet-centric ways of interacting
and relating with robots. To address this limitation and
challenge current assumptions we hold about robots,
we believe design research in HRI should explore
metaphors as a tool for envisioning and developing
artificial social agents that exceed in form and utility the
dominant anthropomorphic or zoomorphic paradigms.
This paper builds on emerging HRI practices and
experiences from the design field to illustrate and
discuss metaphors as an agent of change in robotic
design. We examine the ‘otherness’ of robots through
alternative proposals of design interactions between
humans and robots [25] rather than by mimicking
existing lifeforms. Specifically, we use and extend
the “New Metaphors” method [36]. Through this, we
conceptualize new metaphors, new ways of imagining
modes of interactions and forms of robots that transcend
existing dominant views. We believe this approach can
enrich the spectrum of possible robot imaginaries and
help HRI design researchers develop more diverse and
nuanced visions of future human-robot coexistence.
Another contribution of this work is surfacing underlying
assumptions that exist about robots, a necessary step
toward innovative future designs.
BACKGROUND: THE ROLE OF METAPHORS IN
DESIGN
As classically defined, metaphors are described as
“figures of speech in which a word or phrase literally
denoting one kind of object or idea is used in place
of another to suggest a likeness or analogy between
them”, e.g., “drowning in money” [43]. But, as argued

by [52] and echoed by [10], “a metaphor is more than
a grammatical device: it is a cognitive structure that
plays a significant role in the transference of concepts
between two complex conceptual systems.” As such,
these figures of speech help us understand and make
sense of everyday concepts like time, problems, and
emotions [28].
Metaphors pervade everyday life, not just through
language, but also in the way we think and act [35].
As such, they play a crucial role in understanding
and practicing the design discipline. Indeed, the act
of designing is often presented and discussed through
various metaphors [28], like: a search; a process of
exploration; a journey or bricolage. And, as argued by
[27], the very language of design is highly metaphorical:
narrowing down on a concept; bouncing around ideas;
breaking the problem down; finding a route to a solution;
encouraging wild ideas, and more.
Metaphors also have several practical implications in
design. First, they are largely used to enhance products’
aesthetics and evocativeness [9, 13, 27]. In this case,
defined as a product metaphor [26], the physical
properties of a product intentionally reference another
entity for expressive purposes (see the Mary Biscuit box
by Alessi shaped like a biscuit). Through metaphors,
the product is imbued with meanings and values [13].
Relatedly, another common use of metaphors in design
is to facilitate product understanding [27, 32], which is
particularly important when introducing novel products
and technologies. A popular example of this use is the
desktop metaphor, adopted to facilitate users’interaction
with the first software interfaces [27, 32].
Metaphors, then, are heavily used in the design process
itself. They enable team work [27] by allowing design
teams to develop a shared vision and understanding
of problems and solutions. They facilitate the framing
of problems and situations [10, 11, 17, 27, 28] since
engaging in a process of comparison fosters the
development of new inferences and helps designers
construct problems in unique, insightful ways [28].
Metaphors are also powerful tools that designers can use
to break assumptions and stimulate creativity [10, 11, 13,
14, 32, 36, 46, 55]: they enable novel associations with
the design problem and exploration of unfamiliar design
alternatives [10, 11, 14]. In this work, we explored the
latter use of metaphors in design, i.e., the capacity for
metaphors to bring new perspectives to product design
[32]. Using metaphors in this way can help us change
how we conceptualize and develop robot designs and
relationships between humans and robots.
METAPHORS CHALLENGING HUMAN-ROBOT
INTERACTION ASSUMPTIONS
Many problems are associated with fixation on certain
assumptions in HRI. First, envisioning the design and
development of robots only in utilitarian terms, i.e.,
making robots primarily into servants and encoding
particular norms around power structures, contributed
to dull and repetitive interactions with robots [22]. This
is shown in long-term studies where user engagement
tend to decline with time of interaction, highlighting
the challenge of maintaining high engagement over
prolonged interaction times [1], [31].
Second, robots are assumed to be entities with absolute
knowledge and capabilities. While this assumption might
arise from pop sci-fi culture, real robot’s potentials and
skills remain far more limited than what assumptions
dictate. For example, a study showed that in emergency
evacuation scenarios, people tend to trust robots that
point to an unknown and obscure path rather than follow
clearly marked exit signs. Our misplaced trust in robots is
likely part of the unchallenged assumptions we hold about
their intelligence [47]. Also, many robots fail to meet
our hardware assumptions of ongoing and uninterrupted
functioning. Their parts break, and replacement costs
can be higher than expected. As a consequence, many
robotics companies are failing because market price does
not justify promised benefits [63].
Third, robots make many mistakes, perhaps more than
humans. For a lay user, this may be an unexpected and
disappointing reality. An entire research direction in
HRI focuses on how robots recover from their mistakes
[34, 45]. An important – yet largely neglected – aspect
to consider while designing robots is the surprisingly
common occurrence of robot error, which is critical to
being able to move away from assumptions of perfection
and towards core benefits that robots can provide.
Given these problems, the HRI field has begun to
adopt speculative and critical design approaches that
explore the use of metaphors, more or less explicitly, to
challenge robot assumptions. Concepts like ‘neediness’
[21], ‘domestication’ [4], ‘destruction’ [42], and
‘citizenship’ [41] have been particularly used to broaden
the HRI discourse beyond utilitarian values and mimetic
approaches. In ‘Technological Dream Series: No. 1:
Robots, 2007’ [21], Dunne & Raby break down robot
ideals of autonomy and efficiency through concepts
like neediness which, by suggesting human-robot
co-dependency, represents an unconventional strategy
to mantain a human sense of control over the robot.
The concept of domestication [4] is explored by Auger
to move a critique to a diffused maladaptation of robots
to everyday life. Through this concept, the author
suggests to look at analogous processes that happen
in the animal kingdom, where natural beings become
domestic things, as a way to focus on possible strategies
of adaptation which, in return, would allow robots to
meet their promised potential.
Through the concept of destruction, Luria et al. [42]
opened a dialogue about the robot lifecycle and values
beyond utilitarian role. By being inherently connected
to the process of creation, the concept of destruction
lead us to consider the possible symbolic meaning of
robot materiality. A robot that breaks into parts can
symbolize the longing for the other half in long-distance
relationships, but remain functional even without it. In this
case, destruction of the robot’s physical parts symbolizes
the distance between two people but can also serve as a
reminder of their strong relationship.
Finally, by using the concept of citizenship, Lupetti
et al. [41] described the future of robots’ sociality and

their possible civic embeddedness, exploring how we
can bypass the idea of robots as fully autonomous and
efficient agents with whom humans should negotiate
roles. The authors propose consideration of community-
driven values and other interaction nuances as a way
to design robots that may engage in codependent
relationships with humans. Citizenship, in this piece, is
viewed not in terms of legal rights and responsibilities but
as a metaphor that could facilitate addressing the socio-
relational implications of HRI in public spaces.
Using metaphors to break assumptions about robots,
then, is not novel. Yet, it often manifests as an implicit
practice that remains understandable and applicable
only by the few who already have a rich knowledge
and proficiency in design practices. Thereafter, in this
work, we present a design exploration of metaphors
whose method could potentially be adopted by the wider
community of HRI researchers to reach new frontiers
for social robots.
A DESIGN EXPLORATION OF METAPHORS FOR
HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION
We explored the values and interaction possibilities that
robots can bring to our lives by using metaphors as a
generative tool to break free of traditional assumptions
and elicit imaginative and novel ideas. To this end,
we organized an online Workshop at the International
Conference of Social Robotics1
called “Metaphors for
Human-Robot Interaction”2
. Participants in this workshop
included 28 scholars and artists with varied backgrounds
and interests, including filmmaking, philosophy, design,
computer science, human-computer interaction, fashion,
architecture, mechanical engineering, psychology, and
fine arts.
To generate HRI metaphors, we used the New Metaphors
Toolkit, a card-based design method that leverages
juxtaposition to enable the emergence of hard-to-visualize
phenomena [36]. This Toolkit, usually used in-person,
consists of 150 cards in total, including 75 Thing 1 cards
and 75 Thing 2 cards that can be combined to produce
thousands of possible combinations. Thing 1 cards are
purely textual and contain one word that can describe a
phenomena, e.g., the word: “confidence.” Thing 2 cards
contain an image, generally a photograph, which can be
combined with Thing 1 cards to form a metaphor, e.g.,
an image of a bird. While the New Metaphors Toolkit
has been used to generate new ideas about visualizing
sleep patterns [37], and in other contexts, it had not been
previously applied to HRI or seen as a method to break
free of assumptions about robots.
We adapted the New Metaphors Toolkit to an online
setting and generated an online version of the cards with
a randomizer to ensure the cards were drawn in random
order and not according to participants’ preferences.3
This enabled ideas that initially seemed unlikely to work
together to generate original metaphors [3]. Additionally,
we adapted the cards to a robot scenario. Figures 4 and 5
show an example card.
Our design exploration consisted of three activities that
took about four hours to complete, using a Miro board4
,
an online collaborative whiteboard platform, and Zoom5
breakout rooms.
Activity 1. Participants individually used the metaphor
randomizer to generate as many metaphors for HRI as
they could. Participants clicked the randomizer button
to find a card that would inspire the creation of an HRI
metaphor. If the current generated card did not inspire
the generation of a metaphor, they could click in the
ranzomizer button which would generate a new card for a
maximum of three consecutive times. From the generated
cards, they picked the most inspiring one and generated
a metaphor. This process was repeated and lasted a total
of 13 minutes. We aimed at eliciting wild ideas for the
metaphors, valuing a fast-paced activity. The goal was
to achieve a high amount of metaphors for HRI with
few time to judge or evaluate their value and feasibility.
In total, participants were able to generate 21 original
metaphors.
Activity 2. Participants individually generated metaphors
for the concepts created by others. This resulted in
different HRI metaphors using the same toolkit card,
e.g., Figure 5 shows the generated metaphor “How can
a robot as a duvet jacket be a metaphor for a protected
human-robot relationship?”. Participants had 15 minutes
for this activity and generated a total of 31 metaphors.

Activity 3. Participants, working in groups, picked one
metaphor and created a detailed storyboard around it.
This activity combined brainstorming and collective
mapping to unpack the metaphors’ qualities and create
an abstraction of how they can be applied to HRI.
Participants were distributed in 4 groups of 5-6 and
worked in small groups. They started by unpacking their
idea by discussing the charateristsics of the metaphor
they were working on, and by reflecting on the concept
of robot they wanted to promote. After this, they created
a storyboard detailing how this metaphor for HRI would
be applied to a real-world scenario in the context of
education, home, assistive, and the workplace.
A total of 82 metaphors were generated (see Figure 3),
which we evaluated and elaborated upon in the format of
storyboards. We discussed the meaning of the metaphors
and drew storyboards to showcase desirable real-world
scenarios between humans and robots. We often tried
to understand the deeper meaning of the metaphors by
questioning concepts and visually illustrating them.
The different sketches (see Figure 6) that lead to these
storyboards support the visual imagination thinking
process and helped make the abstract concept behind
a metaphor more concrete, real, conceivable, and
desirable.
The generated metaphors and storyboards serve as the
first main contribution of this work, showcasing how
robots can be envisioned in new relations with humans.
A secondary contribution of our work is to provide a
comprehensive list of current assumptions about robots
and use the generated metaphors as a way to break free
from these assumptions.
BREAKING FREE FROM ASSUMPTIONS IN HUMAN-
ROBOT INTERACTION
The workshop yielded a broad range of speculations
and perspectives about how robots might be different,
but it was insufficient to reframe this design space as
is. To apply all our generated ideation data, we used an
Affinity Diagramming approach to identify and group
ideas according to the assumption that they challenge.
This was the best approach for our process given our
starting point of abundant alternative robot ideas and
our goal of using them to identify unknown assumptions
and reframe the design of robots within the field.
We identified three categories of assumptions that
were challenged in ideation: assumptions about
robot physicality, assumptions about robot role, and
assumptions about robot interactive behavior. While
these categories are not novel and works in HRI already
addressed ways to break free of them by proposing
different ways of conceptualizing robots, this work
provides a comprehensive list of all the assumptions
(both from the workshop and from the literature), which
help better define the problem space. In this section,
we present specific assumptions that were challenged
in each category, followed by a discussion of how
we believe designers and researchers can use them to
reframe their own work. For example, robot designers
can use these assumptions to transform how they
currently design robots, a process that is repetitive and
dated, into a more daring, interesting, and joyful way
of designing robots that will integrate our societies
and interact with us. Despite being challenged by prior
work, these assumptions persist in the minds and work
of researchers, as shown in our workshop. Perhaps this
is because no other work has explicitly defined the
assumptions held for robots and how to subvert them,
as we uniquely contribute in this paper (see Figure 11).
Assumptions in robot physicality
The first set of challenged assumptions address
the robots’ form and physicality—how the robots’
morphology is designed and how their physicality
relates to the surrounding.
Lifelikeness. When the word “robot” is used, people
frequently imagine a human- or animal-like artifact.
Ideas in our workshop challenged this perspective and
suggested robots that look like a doorknob, a shadow, or
as morphing patterns on a brick wall. Some work in the
field suggests robots that are non-anthropomorphic [2],
[40] and that are not life-like, but rather take the form of
moving tangible objects [33, 53, 56].
Otherness. Some robots suggested in the workshop
differed from most robots in that they were not imagined
as separate entities, but rather as part of the human body.
This suggests a more fluid design space between a robot
and a human cyborg. Some ideas include a robot as an
extension of the body (for example, a “third-arm” robot)
[60], robots as wearables, a robot that is constantly
attached to a human (like a parrot sitting on one’s
shoulder), and even a robot as a tumor.
Localness. Most robot designs suggest that a robot is
within a single location [49], yet we find that a single
robot can be in multiple places at once, for example, in
the form of “stations” across space and time. Some work
in this area discusses the ability of robots to re-embody
and co-embody different physical devices and machines
to interact with a person.
Assumptions about robot role
The next set of assumptions address a robot’s role:
what is its primary function and goal when interacting
with individuals? Does it have to be “useful” as usually
suggested in robot designs?
Efficiency. Robots are primarily thought of as machines.
As a result, they are frequently designed as efficiency
tools. Yet robots can serve in roles that we do not usually
associate with machines. For example, a robot might
reflect the status of a home, a person or a situation, or a
robot could be a piece of clothing that is used for self-
expression.
Commodification. People most often consider robots as
something one can purchase, like a smartphone or a
computer. But our process suggests alternatives, such
as robots as art, robots as part of the public sphere,
and robots to support nature. This is in line with recent
calls for taking a more-than human centered design
perspective when shaping complex technologies like
robots [15, 23]. For example, imagining a robot as a
guardian of nature (rather than the human), which clears

APPLYING METAPHORS TO HUMAN-ROBOT
INTERACTION
We further examined the use of metaphors in HRI by
more deeply exploring how the metaphors could become
feasible HRI scenarios. We used illustrated storyboards
as a method [58] to visually represent how selected
metaphors can inspire robot use in public spaces, the
home, education, and assistive contexts.
Our home is our most personal, intimate, and safe space.
We want to feel comfortable and at ease while at the
same time feeling free to be creative and fully ourselves.
We buy plants to promote this atmosphere or acquire pets
to keep us company. In our work, we envision robots that
help us break from routines or habits we want to change.
However, instead of being polite and thoughtful, robots
can be naughty and misbehave to promote change. In the
storyboard, we see the round robot moving to the living
room and bumping into the side table, spilling a mug of
coffee. The robot continues to the couch, leaving splashes
of paint on the floor and everywhere it goes. These
colorful droplets of pain represent a given routine that the
owner wants to change, such as decreasing the amount
of working hours. The more hours the owner works, the
more misbehaved the robot becomes, splashing the house
and the walls with more and more paint. This signals the
owner to stop working, take a break, and enjoy the day.
By deliberately misbehaving, the robot can inspire fast
routine changes. While this may seem irritating, when the
owner looks around the house and sees colors everywhere,
he is reminded of an artistic feeling that lives inside his
own home.
Bridges are part of architectural landscapes and serve to
connect two sides. In the context of our work, we envision
robots as bridges, becoming part of the architecture of
a city. By acquiring this form, robots can transform the
flow of a city since their bridge-bodies are not static
and can move. By moving, a robot influences where people
meet and what they see and do. In the storyboard, a
robot-bridge uses its arms to bound different spaces.
In the first frame (left), the robot takes the form of
a traditional bridge, letting people pass from one side
to the other, connecting two different spatial points.
In the second frame, the robot moves its arms to form
a half-moon shape, creating areas of relaxation where
people can sit and enjoy a picnic. In the third frame, the
robot forms a heart-shape and restricts people to being
inside a space. This area evokes privacy and intimacy,
eliciting emotions associated with marriage proposals but
also with breakups.

In the storyboards, we see a parent explaining to a child
how the world can be dangerous and risky. But these
are abstract concepts for a small child and hard to
understand without having lived them. So a parent gifts
the child a small robot and warns the child that much
care for this robot is needed because it is fragile and can
easily be hurt. The child goes to a nearby park and decides
to play on a swing, leaving the robot farther away on the
green grass. Interested by the egg-shaped robot, a bird
approaches and starts pecking it. Given its fragility, the
robot cracks, making the child sad. The child understands
that more care is needed and goes back to the swing, this
time carrying the robot on their lap, signaling protection
and responsibility.
ASSISTIVE ROBOTICS:
We protect children as they grow. Protecting and
caring for someone implies the existence of important
human abilities, such as empathy, responsibility, and
perseverance. As children grow under our protection,
they themselves acquire these qualities. In the context
of our work, we envision robots as fragile that need care
and protection. By being small, fragile, and in need of
attention, the robot nurtures qualities of empathy and
responsibility in the child.
EDUCATIONAL ROBOTICS:
Hospitals are emotional places that often feel cold and
impersonal. In the context of our work, we envision robots
as a choir in hospitals, representing a team of caregivers,
each acquiring a different and essential role in patient
care. By behaving as a coordinated and harmonious team,
like a choir, robots can promote a sense of security and
transparency for the patient. In the storyboard, we see
a nurse-robot heading to the patient’s room to provide
food and perform essential checkups. The robot can
communicate with the nanorobots that are part of the
patient’s bloodstream to provide accurate information
about the patient’s health needs. The nurse-robot
administers a shot of vitamins to the patient without the
need to wait for blood work results. The subsequent meals
delivered to the patient by the smaller robot were cooked
with ingredients that fasten the patients’ recovery. These
robots work together to form a musical composition for
care, where the patient’s well being is their only priority.

the environment from human-made artifacts, could
serve as guidance to shift design visions from only
making humans more comfortable to designs that rest
within planetary boundaries.
Flawlessness. Many of the ideas in our workshop
countered the idea of a robot as an entity that is perfect at
its job. Instead, much of the discussion was about robots
that are imperfect, need assistance, or perhaps even have
“undesirable” qualities that make them more relatable.
Assumptions about robot interactive behavior
The last set of assumptions challenge some of the
interaction paradigms that are common for robots.
Positivity. Today, most agents and robots that we interact
with are polite, positive and pleasant. In this workshop
many alternatives were explored, including robots
that are ill intentioned or that are rude, grumpy or
forgetful. These are all opportunities to have alternative
interactions with robots than what we are currently
accustomed to.
Predictability. Most interactions with robots are also
somewhat predictable, or at least strive to be so. But is
that necessarily the best option? Some ideas suggested
randomness and improvisation as key features, or even
an inconsistent identity for robots by design.
Independence. Another assumption we identified
suggests that robots are independent entities that work
on their own and do not require any assistance unless
they need human supervision [48]. Some generated
ideas to counter this narrative include groups of robots
that work as a collective, a dependent robot that needs
help to complete its task, and a vulnerable robot that is
primarily cared for.
Human-likeness. Much effort in robotics is spent to
perfect human ways of interaction: computer-vision,
natural language processing and haptics, among
others. Non-human interaction channels are much less
frequently explored in the field. In the workshop we
examined the use of color, motion and sound effects as
alternative channels of communication with robots.
Reflecting on assumptions
We view these groups of assumptions as tools to
challenge future designs of robots and agents. While
many of these assumptions have been overcome by
researchers and designers, individuals new to this field
are likely to join the fixated narrative of “robots.” By
reviewing a particular idea for a new robot through the
different assumption-breaking lenses we propose here,
researchers and designers can more promptly overcome
the fixation stage of their work.
For example, consider a designer tasked with creating a
robottogreetpeopleinastore.Thedesignermightuseour
list of assumptions to ask: Should this robot be human-
like, animal-like, or closer to an inanimate object? Does
this robot need to be completely independent, or can it
rely on other people and devices to complete its task? Is
this robot a single entity that is located in a single place,
or should it be more distributed? We believe that this
list of assumptions can assist in countering the strong
associations and narratives that are implied when using
Fig 11. HRI assumptions and challenging metaphors.

the word “robot” and allow the field to collectively,
rather than anecdotally, broaden the contribution of
robot design explorations far beyond what we can
currently witness.
Building on what we have seen in previous work (e.g.,
[4]), we claim that design can answer – up to a large
extent – to the growing demand for reflections and
investigations on the impact and desirability of the
robotic futures we propose. In Augers’ words: design
influences HRI by encouraging more ‘focus on the
complex reality of everyday life, the idiosyncrasies of
people, the role of trends, status symbols, aesthetics,
and more’ [4]. As such, we believe that conducting
these types of design explorations, aimed at challenging
assumptions, would benefit the HRI field far beyond
allowing divergent thinking when ideating about robots.
They can rather help us speculate on what might be
the potential consequences of the robots we design
if contextualized and situated within existing social
practices. Through counter-intuitive associations of
ideas and ‘para-functional’ proposals, these types of
design explorations can help the HRI field to develop a
critical mindset towards its own practice.
As emerged from our investigation, exploring
unconventional robot metaphors, such as robots
that make mistakes or act unpredictably, lead us to
profound considerations of social, cultural, and ethical
implications of robotic artifacts. While we sought to
provoke new ways to think about robots, the initial
selection of metaphors, images, and the associations that
participants made in the workshop were nevertheless
rooted in particular worldviews and cultural and social
perspectives and experiences. Even in seeking to
promote more pluralistic approaches, the standpoints
of the people and materials are still very much present
in the resulting concepts. This too should be part of a
reflective stance on the work.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, we explored the use of metaphors as a
tool to challenge existing assumptions in designing
HRI interactions as well as a framework to collectively
explore novel ones. We surveyed prevailing assumptions
about robots, which generally typecast them as flawless
and subservient entities. To broaden the perspectives
of robot roles, we challenged these assumptions by
applying metaphors to frame robots against other
concepts. We used the format of a workshop to explore
metaphors as a creative method in HRI, gathering ideas
that challenged underlying assumptions of robots,
most notably regarding their physicality, roles, and
interactive behaviors. The interaction design research
community is well placed to offer creative reframing
in the development of robots: designers’ approaches,
such as the method we have illustrated here, can provide
a framework for roboticists. In particular, the New
Metaphors method provides a framework for roboticists
to break free from preconceived notions and broaden
the design space of robots. We referenced outcomes
generated throughout our workshop as initial inspiration.
Future work involves expanding on the themes emerging
as a result of intentionally engaging in assumption-
breaking thinking in HRI interaction design. By
deepening our understanding of the implicit and explicit
dampening effects of these assumptions on the creative
process, we can generate innovative priors that help both
new and experienced HRI designers unlock novel design
paradigms. This work can inspire roboticists, designers,
artists, linguists, and engineers to develop robots that far
surpass our current assumptions by acquiring different
roles, shapes and forms, and interaction modalities with
humans.
