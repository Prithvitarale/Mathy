Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have emerged as a new two dimensional materials
field since the monolayer and few-layer limits show different properties when compared to each
other and to their respective bulk materials. For example, in some cases when the bulk material is
exfoliated down to a monolayer, an indirect-to-direct band gap in the visible range is observed. The
number of layers N (N even or odd) drives changes in space group symmetry that are reflected in the
optical properties. The understanding of the space group symmetry as a function of the number of
layers is therefore important for the correct interpretation of the experimental data. Here we present
a thorough group theory study of the symmetry aspects relevant to optical and spectroscopic
analysis, for the most common polytypes of TMDCs, i.e. 2Ha, 2Hc and 1T, as a function of the
number of layers. Real space symmetries, the group of the wave vectors, the relevance of inversion
symmetry, irreducible representations of the vibrational modes, optical selection rules and Raman
tensors are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
The interest in two-dimensional layered materials was enhanced after the successful iso-
lation of monolayer graphene (the 2D component of graphite) reported in 2004.1
The mono-
layer of hexagonally linked carbon atoms made it possible to study a brand-new set of mag-
netic, electric and optical phenomena related to the Dirac-like nature of graphene electrons.2
The lack of a band gap, however, imposes some difficulties to graphene’s application in elec-
tronics, despite its high carrier mobility.
Other classes of 2D materials are now also being intensively studied for many different
applications motivated mainly by the need of a band gap. Perovskite-based oxides, van der
Waals solids, such as Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3,3
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),4
and transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as MoS2 and WSe2,5–7
offer a wide range of compounds and
combinations with potential use in the emerging field of 2D heterostructures8
(for example,
tunable optoelectronic properties are obtained by a suitable choice of component layers9,10
).
The TMDCs are layered materials of the form MX2, where “M” stands for groups 4 − 10
of transition metals and “X” stands for the chalcogen atoms S, Se or Te.11
The “M” and
“X” atoms are strongly linked through covalent bonds to form 2D layers. Two adjacent
sheets of chalcogen atoms are separated by a sheet of transition metal atoms in an X-
M-X configuration, and the “monolayer” is actually composed of an atomic trilayer (TL)
structure. The interaction among these trilayers are weak van der Waals interactions. The
difference in the stacking order gives rise to different polytypes, while the combination of
these different atoms leads to a variety of more than 30 different layered materials, with
different optical, mechanical and electrical properties.11–13
Some semiconducting TMDCs in this so-called monolayer form show a direct band gap
in the visible range, which does not exist in their bulk counterparts.5–7,14,15
These band
gaps open the possibility for flexible and transparent sensor applications,11,12,16
and the
construction of heterostructures offers the possibility of tuning the TMDC behavior.9,10,16
The breaking of inversion symmetry in the monolayer, with the strong spin-orbit interaction
coming from the metal d orbitals, gives rise to the spin splitting of the valence band at
the high-symmetry K points of the Brillouin Zone (BZ).17
Since the K and K0
points
in the BZ are related to each other by time reversal symmetry, the spin splitting yields
distinct symmetries from these two valleys, and the manipulation of this coupling opens the
2
possibility of a variety of valleytronic applications.17–22
The dependence on the number of layers (N) and on the changes of the symmetry group
have already been investigated in the characterization of the various TMDC optical prop-
erties, by means of Raman spectroscopy and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG).21,23–29
Group theory provides a valuable theoretical tool that can be used to understand the selec-
tion rules for the optical transitions, to find the eigenvectors for the lattice vibrations, and
to identify the lifting of degeneracies due to external symmetry-breaking perturbations.30,31
A detailed study of these symmetry aspects for few-layers TMDCs is valuable to predict in-
teresting characteristics and to properly interpret experimental results for these compounds,
since few-layers TMDCs will belong to different space groups according to the number of
layers, and their space groups will be different from those of their bulk crystal counterparts.
Group theory has already been used to describe the structure of TMDCs in the bulk
form, for different polytypes,32,33
in the few-TL 2Hc polytype for zone center phonons (at
the Γ BZ point)23–25
and electronic structure at the Γ and K points,34
and for more detailed
understanding of some non-linear optical processes.26
In this work, group theory is applied
to TMDCs in both the trigonal prismatic (H) and octahedral (T) metal atom coordinations,
considering the stacking order for 2Ha and 2Hc for H, and 1T for T, and the dependence
on the number of layers N (even or odd), and considering the full set of wave vectors in
the BZ, i.e., going beyond the zone center. In section II, the symmetry analysis in real
space is developed for the 2H (section II A 1) and 1T (section II A 2) polytypes, while the
reciprocal space treatment is shown in section II B. The relevance of inversion symmetry for
the different TMDCs polytypes is discussed in section II C. The irreducible representations
for vibrational modes for few-TL TMDCs considering the high-symmetry points and lines in
the BZ are presented in section II D, and the Raman and infrared selection rules are shown
in section II E, while section II F gives the Raman tensors. Finally, section III summarizes
the main conclusions and comments on the cases of lowering of symmetry induced by strain
in MoS2, by engineering heterostructures, and by breaking the out-of-plane translational
symmetry in WSe2.

II. SYMMETRY ANALYSIS
A. Real space symmetry
The family of layered TMDCs is composed of several polytypes with a different number
of TLs, or different metal atom coordination that form the primitive unit cell. The main
polytypes under experimental and theoretical consideration nowadays (and analyzed in the
present work) are the trigonal prismatic 2H [2 TLs in a trigonal prismatic coordination
(H) are required to form the bulk primitive unit cell] and the octahedral 1T [1TL in an
octahedral coordination (T) is required to form the bulk primitive unit cell] (see Fig. 1).
Each polytype, in turn, has a monolayer (1TL) as a basic 2D building block unit. The bulk
crystal is made by piling up these monolayer units, namely 1H (trigonal prismatic or AbA
coordination, where upper cases represent chalcogen atoms and lower cases represent metal
atoms) and 1T (octahedral or AbC coordination), as can be observed in Figs. 1 (a) and
(b), respectively. The blue spheres represent transition metal atoms, and the orange spheres
represent the chalcogen atoms. For bulk versions of these layered materials, where the out-
of-plane translational symmetry is present, the lateral view of the unit cells are highlighted
with red rectangles in Figs. 1 (c), (d) and (e).
There are several other polytypes for stacks of more than two TLs, and at least 11
polytypes where identified in TMDCs.33
For example, the unit cell of the 3R-MoS2 (with
the stacking /AbA BcB CaC/)32,33
comprises 9 atoms in 3TLs. The treatment of these
polytypes with a high number of TLs is beyond the scope of this work but, for the 3R case,
Table I summarizes some symmetry considerations and gives representative examples.
1. 2H polytype
The 2H bulk polytype can assume two forms with different stacking symmetries: 2Ha
(or /AbA CbC/ stacking),32,33
and 2Hc (/CaC AcA/ stacking).33
In 2Ha stacking, one
transition metal atom is always on top of another transition metal atom of the next layer,
as shown in Fig. 1 (c). This polytype is reported to occur in NbSe2, NbS2, TaS2 and TaSe2
crystals.32
In 2Hc stacking, any transition metal atom is sitting on top of two chalcogenides
atoms of the subsequent layer, as shown in Fig. 1 (d). This polytype occurs in MoS2,
WS2, MoSe2 and WSe2 crystals. Both polytypes belong to the non-symmorphic hexagonal
4
space group P63/mmc32
(D4
6h, in Schönflies notation, or #194 in the International Tables
for Crystallography35
). The primitive unit cell for the bulk has 6 atoms (Z = 2, where Z is
the number of structural MX2 units required to form the primitive unit cell), and 3 atoms in
each TL, as can be seen in the red rectangles of Figs. 1 (c) and (d). The Wyckoff positions
for the 2H bulk polytypes, as well as the number of structural formulas Z are given in Table
I.
The 2Hb polytype is possible and occurs for nonstoichiometric compounds with an excess
of metal atoms intercalated in the van der Waals gap.33
Table I gives symmetry information
and examples for this polytype. Some differences between the definition of 2Hb and 2Hc
are found in literature,32,33
and the most recent nomenclature is used in this work.33,36

respectively) of the primitive unit cells for bulk TMDCs materials are shown. The black rhombuses
show the top view of the primitive unit cell, and the red rectangles indicate the lateral view. The
primitive unit cell of the 2Ha (c) or the 2Hc (d) polytypes comprise 6 atoms, 2 transition metal
atoms and 4 chalcogenides (Z = 2) in the trigonal prismatic coordination illustrated in (a), while
the 1T polytype shown in (e) has 3 atoms, comprising 2 chalcogenides and 1 transition metal atom
(Z = 1) in the octahedral coordination illustrated in (b).

For few-layers systems there is a reduction in symmetry due to the lack of translational
symmetry along the z axis (the z axis is perpendicular to the basal plane of the TLs). The
symmetry operations are reduced from 24 in the bulk to 12 for both even and odd numbers
of TLs. Therefore, the few-TLs space groups are different from the bulk space groups and
depend on the parity of the number of layers (even or odd number of TLs). Figure 2
illustrates 1TL and 2TL stacking arrangements for the 2Hc polytype. The hexagonal real
space for 1TL and 2TLs are given in Figs. 2 (a) and (d), respectively.
The 2Hc polytype symmetry operations are illustrated in Figs. 2 (b) and (e), which
are the top-view of the primitive unit cells. In Figs. 2 (c) and (f), the lateral views of
the primitive unit cells are given for 1TL and 2TLs, respectively. The 1TL of 2H polytype
belongs to the P6̄m2 (D1
3h or #187) hexagonal symmorphic space group, as well as to other
few-layers compounds with odd number of layers, whose point symmetry operations are E
(identity), 2C3 [clockwise and anti-clockwise rotations of 120◦
about the axis represented as a
black triangle in Fig. 2 (b)], 3C0
2 (two-fold axis in the σh plane), σh (the horizontal reflection
plane that passes through the transition metal atom), 2S3 (C3 clockwise and anti-clockwise
rotations, followed by a σh reflection), and 3σv (vertical reflection planes).
The 2TLs of 2H polytype and any other even number of TLs, belong to the D3
3d (P3̄m1,
#164) symmorphic space group, whose symmetry operations are E, 2C3, 3C0
2 [rotation axes
placed in between two adjacent TLs, i. e., in the middle of the van der Waals gap in Fig. 2
(f)], inversion i [red dot in the σh plane of Fig. 2 (f)], 3σd [dihedral vertical mirror planes
represented by red lines in Fig. 2 (e)] and 2S6 (clockwise and anti-clockwise rotations of
60◦
followed by a σh reflection). For the 3TLs case, when another TL unit is added to the
2TLs shown in Figs. 2 (d), (e) and (f), the symmetry operations are the same as those
observed for 1TL, since the σh plane is recovered as a symmetry operation. The addition of
subsequent layers will always show symmetry variations depending on whether the number
of layers is odd or even, and the difference between these two groups is ultimately given by
the presence of the inversion symmetry in 2TLs (which is absent in 1TL) and the presence
of the σh plane in 1TL (which is absent in 2TLs).

spheres represent transition metal atoms and orange spheres represent chalcogen atoms. (a) and
(d) show the top view for the 1TL and 2TLs, respectively. ~
a1 and ~
a2 are the primitive unit
vectors, indicated in (a), while (b) and (e) represent the symmetry operations for the 1TL and
2TLs, respectively. The C3 axes are perpendicular to the xy plane in (b) and (e), and they are
represented by black triangles. Three vertical mirror planes σv and three dihedral mirror planes σd
are indicated as red lines in (b) and (e), respectively, while the black lines are the three C0
2 rotation
axes in the horizontal mirror σh, represented in (c) and (f) together with the primitive unit cell.
The σh itself is not a symmetry operation for 2TLs, but it is discussed here since it is part of the
S6 operation, which is given as a C6 rotation followed by a σh reflection in this plane. The red
lines in (e) denote the σd mirror planes, and the red dot in the center of (f) indicates the position
of the inversion symmetry operation.
2. 1T polytype
From a symmetry standpoint, the 1T polytype is constructed by piling up single 1TL
units, where each subsequent layer is exactly the same as the previous one, with one transi-
tion metal atom (or chalcogen atom) on top of another transition metal atom (or chalcogen
atom), in an octahedral coordination. In the bulk TMDC, the stacking is /AbC/AbC/ (see
Fig. 1). The bulk form belongs to the D3
3d (P3̄m1, #164) symmorphic space group. The
unit cell comprises 3 atoms of one TL [red rectangle in Fig. 1 (e)]. The Wyckoff positions
and number of structural formulas (Z) for the 1T polytype TMDCs are given in Table I.
8
Because all layers are identical, the symmetry operations do not change by increasing the
number of TLs, no matter if N is even or odd. Figures 3 (a) and (d) show the 1TL and
2TLs structures, respectively, of the 1T polytype. The symmetry operations of 1TL are:
E, 2C3, 3C0
2 [the C0
2 rotation axes are in the reflection plane, between the two chalcogen
atoms, dividing in half the transition metal atom, as showed in the black lines in Fig. 3
(c)], inversion i (red dot in the transition metal atom), 3σd [dihedral vertical mirror planes
represented by red lines in Fig. 3 (b)] and 2S6 (clockwise and anti-clockwise rotations of 60◦
followed by a σh reflection). In the 2TL case, the same operations are still valid, but now
the reflection plane (Fig. 3 (f)) for the S6 operation is located in the van der Waals gap.
FIG. 3. (Color online) Primitive unit cell and symmetry operations of the 1T TMDCs polytype
(bulk, 1TL and 2TLs). (a) and (d) show the 1TL and 2TL top view. In (d), chalcogen atoms are
on top of chalcogen atoms, and transition metal atoms are on top of transition metal atoms, giving
a similar top view to that observed for 1TL. In (b) and (e), the C3 rotation axes (represented as
black triangles) are perpendicular to the basal plane. The red lines represent σd mirror planes,
while the black lines stand for C0
2 rotation axes that lie in the σh plane. The primitive unit cells
for 1TL (and bulk) and for 2TLs are shown in (c) and (f), respectively, and the red dot in their
centers denotes the inversion operations. Notice that σh is not a symmetry operation for 1TL (or
N odd), 2TLs (or N even) or bulk, but the reflection plane is shown here to indicate the reflection
in the 2S6 operations.

The differences between the space groups D1
3h and D3
3d when the number of TLs is odd
or even define different symmetries for the Group of the Wave Vectors (GWV) at each high-
symmetry point or direction of the reciprocal space. Knowledge of the GWV is important
because the invariance of the Hamiltonian under symmetry operations usually leads to de-
generacies at these high-symmetry points or directions in the BZ.37–39
The GWV for the
2H TMDCs is similar to the GWV found for N-layer graphene and bulk graphite,40
since
the space groups for bulk, N even, and N odd (N≥ 3) TLs in the TMDC family resemble
the corresponding graphene systems. However, the 1TL case in TMDCs lacks the inversion
10
symmetry and therefore belongs to the same space group (P6̄m2) as that for other N-odd
thin layers. Table II shows the point groups that are isomorphic to the GWV for all the BZ
high-symmetry points and axes occuring for bulk and for both odd or even number of TLs
in 2H polytype.
The 1T polytype has the same GWV regardless of the number of layers in the sample.
The bulk is symmorphic, so it has the same GWV. Table III shows the GWV for different
high-symmetry points and axes within the BZ for this polytype.
C. The relevance of inversion symmetry
The presence or absence of inversion symmetry is an important aspect of TMDCs, since
it opens the possibility of coupled spin and valley physics.17
The strong Spin-Orbit Coupling
in TMDC materials is due to the d orbitals in their heavy metal atoms. The absence of
inversion symmetry lifts the degeneracy of the same energy at the same ~
k value, at the K
point of the BZ, and spin splitting values on the order of 0.4 eV have been observed in
WSe2.21
The inversion symmetry is also important for the Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG)
technique, which has been routinely used to probe not only the presence of inversion sym-
metry, but also the crystal orientation26,27
and, recently, the effect in SHG of two artificially
stacked TMDCs layers.41
For centrosymmetric crystals, the χ(2)
nonlinear susceptibility
vanishes,42
and SHG signal is not observed. The 2H TMDCs polytype (and in this case, it
also includes the 1TL), belong to the non-centrosymmetric space group D1
3h and then it is
possible to observe the SHG.21,26–28,41–43
The N-even TLs for 2H TMDCs do not show SHG,
since their space groups are centrosymmetric. For the 1T TMDCs polytype, both N-even
and N-odd TLs have the same centrosymmetric space group D3
3d, and the SHG signal is
not expected. In this sense, the SHG mapping (together with other characterization tools)
could be used to detect different polytypes in the same sample, since the 2H polytype with
an odd number of layers shows SHG, while the layered 1T polytype does not.

D. Irreducible representations for vibrational modes
The irreducible representations for the lattice vibrations (Γvib
) are given by the direct
product Γvib
=Γeq
⊕Γvec
, where Γeq
denotes the equivalence representation for the atomic sites,
and Γvec
is the representation for the x, y and z real space vectors.38
The Γvec
representation
can be written as Γvec
=Γx
⊕Γy
⊕Γz
, or Γvec
=Γx,y
⊕Γz
when x and y have the same irreducible
representation. The Γvib
representations for the 2Ha, 2Hc and 1T polytypes are given in
Tables IV, V and VI, respectively, for all the BZ high-symmetry points and lines (shown
in Fig. 4), and for odd or even numbers of TLs. It is worth noticing that for the 2Hc
polytype, the Γvib
for the K0
point is the complex conjugated form of the Γvib
for the K
point, while for the 2Ha polytype, the atomic sites are different (due to different Wyckoff
positions) and the Γvib
of the K and K0
points are the same. In the 1T polytype, the Γvib
for
the K and K0
points are also the same. The conversion from the Space Group (SG) to the
Point Group (PG) notation for the irreducible representations is indicated in each character
table of the Supplementary Material.44
The irreducible representations for vibrations for
each high-symmetry point and line of the BZ for all the bulk polytypes are also given in
Tables SI, SII and SIII of the Supplementary Material.44

E. Raman and infrared selection rules
For bulk 2H polytypes (1T polytype), the lattice vibration irreducible representations
Γvib
for the 18 (9) zone center phonons are reproduced in the first line of Table VII (see
also Tables SI and SII from Supplementary Material).44
The classification of the modes as
Raman active, infrared (IR) active, acoustic, and silent are given in Table VII.

For the 2D polytypes, the Raman and IR active modes show symmetry variations de-
pending on the number of layers, since the high-symmetry Γ points have different GWV.

The GWV at the Γ point is D1
3h for N-odd 2H polytypes, D3

In the 1T polytype, since the space group is the same in both N-even and N-odd, the
representations for the few-TL films of this polytype refer to the same irreducible represen-
tations of the group of the wave vector D3
3d at the Γ point, which, in turn, are the same as
those found for its bulk counterpart.
F. Raman tensors
To define whether or not a specific vibrational mode will be experimentally observed in a
given Raman scattering geometry, we use here the Porto notation,45,46
which indicates the
crystal orientation with respect to the polarization and propagation directions of the laser.
15
Four letters are used in the Porto notation to describe the scattering process in the a(bc)d
form: while “a” and “d” are the propagation directions of the incident and scattered light,
respectively, “b” and “c” represent the polarization directions for the incident and scattered
light, respectively. One common Raman experimental geometry is the backscattering con-
figuration, where the incident and scattered light have an opposite sense. For example, in
the z(xy)z configuration the z and z are the directions of the incident and scattered light,
with the opposite sense, x is the polarization direction of the incident light, and y is the
polarization direction of the scattered light.
The Raman scattering intensity given by the Hamiltonian perturbation term is propor-
tional to |b
es.←
→
α b
ei|2
, where b
es is the unit vector along the polarization direction of the scat-
tered light, b
ei is the unit vector along the polarization direction of the incident light, and
←
→
α is the Raman tensor. The quadratic functions (xx, xy, xz, yz...) indicate the irreducible
representations for the Raman-active modes. Following this procedure, the Raman tensors
for all the Raman active modes of N-layer thin films can be found. For the 2H polytype
with N-odd few layers (D1
3h group of the wave vector for the Γ point), the Raman tensors
are:47

III. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS
In this work, symmetry-related aspects of bulk and N-layer 2Ha, 2Hc and 1T TMDCs
polytypes were discussed from a group theory perspective. The analysis of the presence of
inversion symmetry gives different behaviors (in the case of odd number of TLs) for the
same number of layers in a given material, with different polytypes. Therefore, it is possible
to design experiments to probe, for example, the presence of different polytypes within the
same sample, with the same number of layers. The breaking of inversion symmetry is crucial
in materials suitable for specific applications, like the development of valleytronic devices,
and group theory predictions give directions to researches on how to design their devices to
achieve their desired symmetry-related goals.
Some perturbations can lower the symmetry of these thin films and this approach has
been used to tune some characteristics of these materials. In strained MoS2 monolayer,
17
where the doubly degenerate Raman active mode E0
splits into E0−
and E0+
peaks (de-
pending on the magnitude and symmetry of the strain), an optical band gap was found and
it is approximately linear with strain for both monolayer and bilayer MoS2.30,31,48
By using
different TMDCs, it is possible to engineer the optical band gap of interest to the researcher.
Another possibility is the piling of different TMDCs to engineer new heterostructures, where
the inversion symmetry is broken with more options made available by using multiple ma-
terials. Such heterostructures are expected, for example, to give rise to tunable band gaps
from 0.79 to 1.16 eV.9
In the present work, the symmetry properties of the vibrational modes were found for
the high symmetry points and lines in the BZ, extending previous knowledge beyond the
zone center phonons in TMDCs. One important aspect of this symmetry analysis is that,
from symmetry variations, it is possible to predict the difference in phonon modes in these
structures. N new Raman-active modes have been observed in few layers TMDCs like in
WSe2.24
Density functional theory (DFT) combined with polarization dependent Raman
measurements and group theory were used to understand the first-order Raman spectra.
For example, the appearance of the inactive mode B1
2g in bulk WSe2 and only at specific
laser lines is still not well understood and is usually attributed to resonance effects.24
How-
ever, for N even and N odd few layers, A1g (for N even TLs) and A0
1 (for N odd TLs)
are both observed at 310 cm−1
. Furthermore, the E1g mode at around 175 cm−1
in bulk
WSe2 (2Hc polytype) is not measurable under the backscattering configuration along the z
direction of light propagation, as well as the E00
mode for 1TL of the same polytype (see the
Raman tensors in section II F). In films with N ≥ 2, the E00
mode develops into Eg symme-
try, for N-even TLs, and into E0
modes for N-odd layers, which are both detectable under
z(xx)z and z(xy)z polarizations (and these different behaviors are not related to substrate
effects, since these modes are also detected in suspended samples).24
The mode at 260 cm−1
in bulk was previously attributed to the Raman active out-of-plane A1g mode, but polariza-
tion measurements have shown that even for z(xy)z polarization this mode is observed, in
contrast with the group theoretical prediction and the previous symmetry assignment. This
mode was consequently attributed to second-order Raman scattering.24
Similar results were
observed for MoTe2
25
and are expected for other TMDCs. The complete group theory anal-
ysis described here should be used to guide researchers in making correct mode assignments
using the tables and discussion given in the present work.

I. Lattice vibration representations for bulk 2Ha, 2Hc and 1T
In this appendix we list the lattice vibration irreducible representations Γvib
(discussed
in section II D of the main manuscript) for each high-symmetry point and line in the BZ
for the bulk 2Ha, 2Hc and 1T polytypes in Tables S I, S II and S III, respectively. The
character tables of spacial groups modified to the GWV of each high-symmetry point and
line of BZ are given with respect to the points and lines indicated in red in Fig. 4 of the
main manuscript.

II. Character tables of spacial groups modified to the group of the wave vector
(GWV) of each point and line of high symmetry in the BZ.
Tables S IV to S IX give the character tables for the GWV for the 2Ha and 2Hc bulk
polytypes. Tables S X to S XV give the character tables to the GWV for the 2H polytype
with N-odd layers, while Tables S XVI to S XX give the character tables for the GWV for
the 2H polytype with N-even layers. The space group for the 1T bulk polytype, as well
as that for N-even and N-odd layers (the 1T bulk polytype is symmorphic) is the P3̄m1
(D3
3d or #164) and the GWV for each high-symmetry point or line in the BZ is the same,
regardless of the number of layers. The GWV for each high-symmetry point or line in the
BZ for the 1T polytype is the same as that which occurs in the 2H polytype with an even
number of layers, and the Tables S XVI to S XX should be used for this polytype. The
tables contain the Space Group (SG) and Point Group (PG) notation for the irreducible
representations, and they are given in the following order:
1. Spacial groups used for bulk of the 2H polytype
2. Spacial groups used for N-odd few layers of the 2H polytype
3. Spacial groups used for N-even few layers of the 2H polytype and for N layer and
bulk 1T polytype.
