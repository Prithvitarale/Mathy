ABSTRACT
Despite being included in mainstream schools, visually im-
paired children still face barriers to social engagement and
participation. Games could potentially help, but games that
cater for both visually impaired and sighted players are scarce.
We used a co-design approach to design and evaluate a robot-
based educational game that could be inclusive of both visually
impaired and sighted children in the context of mainstream
education. We ran a focus group discussion with visual im-
pairment educators to understand barriers to inclusive play.
And then a series of co-design workshops to engage visually
impaired and sighted children and educators in learning about
robot technology and exploring its potential to support in-
clusive play experiences. We present design guidelines and
an evaluation workshop of a game prototype, demonstrating
group dynamics conducive to collaborative learning experi-
ences, including shared goal setting/execution, closely coupled
division of labour, and interaction symmetry.

INTRODUCTION
Visually impaired (VI) and blind children are increasingly edu-
cated in mainstream rather than special schools [42]. However,
despite being included with their sighted peers, recent research
identified persistent issues with participation [51, 56], reduced
opportunities for collaborative learning and social engagement
[5, 19] and potential for isolation [34]. These challenges are
in part attributed to the structural and technical support that
VI children receive in mainstream schools [34]. In particular,
assistive learning technologies are often designed to be used
by VI pupils alone and not by sighted peers, and can therefore
reduce opportunities for inclusive learning experiences.

Educational games could reduce barriers to inclusion. Games
are effective means for learning [12] and, if designed with in-
clusion in mind, they can promote interactions that are equally
engaging to both sighted and VI children [35]. However, ac-
cessible technologies, including accessible games, tend to
focus on the needs of a specific target user group: for example
those in need of accessibility support. This can work against
objectives of inclusion since games that are designed to be
accessible for VI players tend to be simplified to a point that
makes them non-engaging to sighted players [48]. Meanwhile,
games for sighted players are heavily visual, and therefore
difficult to access for visually impaired players. In practice,
this means games that can engage both visually impaired and
sighted children are scarce. This raises a need to explore the
design of technologies that promote inclusive play between
disabled and non-disabled players in general, and poses a
challenge for the design of inclusive educational games for
disabled and non-disabled children in mainstream schools.
In this work, we explored how to support inclusive play expe-
riences between children with and without visual impairments
with the aim of promoting inclusive learning experiences in
mainstream schools. In particular, we explored the extent to
which off-the-shelf robotic devices, which are not designed
with accessibility in mind, could be used to design an inclu-
sive educational game. Additionally, we analysed the forms
of inclusive play experiences that this may engender. We thus
extend current work in this area by focusing on co-designing
an inclusive educational game in a new context of interaction
(mainstream schools), and with a mix of stakeholders (children
with and without VIs and their educators). This characterises
our approach as one that does not use the needs of a particu-
lar group as a starting point. We do this by addressing three
key research questions: 1) What challenges and barriers are
there to inclusive play experiences for visually impaired and
sighted children in mainstream schools? 2) How can we co-
design inclusive play technologies with participants who have
mixed visual abilities? and 3) In what way does the resulting
technology support inclusive play experiences?
To answer these questions, we conducted focus group dis-
cussions with experts in the education of visually impaired
children to learn more about challenges and barriers to inclu-
sive play experiences. We then ran co-design workshops with
visually impaired and sighted children and their educators to
learn about robot technologies and how these could be used to
design an inclusive educational game. From these activities
we derived a set of guidelines for the design of inclusive play
experiences. We then recruited a group of game designers
to develop a game concept using these guidelines, which we
then developed into a prototype and evaluated in an inclusive
school. We thus make the following contributions: 1) a charac-
terisation of barriers to inclusive play in mainstream schools;
2) a demonstration of how engaging children and educators
with mixed visual abilities through inclusive co-design activ-
ities enable joint production of radically new conceptions of
technologies for inclusive play experiences; 3) an outline and
discussion of a set of broad guidelines for inclusive play for
disabled and non-disabled children.
BACKGROUND
Inclusive Education Technologies
Inclusive education grew out of a wave of school reforms to
address the structural causes of inequalities between students
needs, especially students with disabilities [53]. Inclusive edu-
cation emphasises practices that allow pupils to experience and
embrace diversity, including teaching approaches that enable
learners to participate fully in a mainstream setting regardless
of their needs [47]. In the UK, the move toward inclusive
education was accompanied by an increase in the number of
teaching assistants (TAs) working in mainstream schools [17,
44]. However, evidence from recent reviews suggests that
TAs rarely receive the necessary support and training they
need, and that this contributes to increasing provision and ex-
periential challenges for pupils with additional support needs
[17, 20]. Children with VIs have complex needs that require
appropriate provisions [3]. They have limited access to the cur-
riculum via the visual medium, and accessing information via
alternative mediums such as Braille, is often time-consuming
or not possible [22]. A child with a severe VI is also likely to
require additional support in developing social skills [43]. A
number of researchers have developed novel accessibility and
assistive technologies (ATs) that address such issues. Exam-
ples include, a portable note-taker to provide blind students
with better access to classroom presentations [24], methods
for auditory access to mathematical formulae [40], and rapid
prototyping of learning materials using 3D printing [32].
Research on mixed-ability classrooms also shows increasing
evidence that inclusive education technologies designed for
both visually impaired and sighted children can alleviate some
of the challenges associated with inclusive provisions. For
instance, Thieme et al. developed an inclusive tool for collabo-
rative coding [49], Freeman et al. explored the introduction of
auditory beacons to support mobility and social engagement
for visually impaired and sighted children [19], and Metatla
et al. demonstrated support for engagement between children
with mixed visual abilities through inclusive co-design tech-
niques [34, 36] and voice-user interfaces [35]. Nonetheless,
uptake of novel ATs in educational settings continues to be
limited [7] due to a number of issues, including stigmatisa-
tion [46] and perceived usefulness [41]. Screen-reader and
screen enlargement software and hardware continue to be the
dominant ATs used by VI children in mainstream schools [32,
34]. This suggests that involving children with and without
visual impairments as well as their educators in the design
of inclusive educational technologies can improve uptake by
ensuring designs are informed by and adequately embedded
within ongoing practices and provisions.
Inclusive Co-design
Co-designing with and for visually impaired people has been
explored across a range of domains. For example, to develop
support for sensory motor rehabilitation of children with VIs
[29], to co-design accessible toys [33], and multisensory edu-
cational technologies [34, 8]. Research has also demonstrated
that co-designing technology with children with special educa-
tion needs (SEN) is valued for creating meaningful technology
as well as for enriching and empowering children’s experi-
ences [18]. Many researchers are now actively seeking to
involve children with SEN in the design of new educational
technologies (e.g. [31, 55, 35, 14]). However, little research
has explored inclusive co-design involving visually impaired
and sighted children, and educators. Yet, this is particularly
important when aiming to support inclusive education so that
the context is more authentically understood [6, 34, 14].
Games for Visually Impaired Players
Previous research has addressed the need to make games acces-
sible for visually impaired players, either by adapting existing
games [4, 54, 48] or by creating new dedicated games [10, 38].
Research has particularly focused on adopting appropriate in-
teraction modalities such as haptic or auditory feedback. For
example, Blind Hero [54] replaces visual with haptic stimuli,
in this case a glove with vibratory feedback, so that players
know which buttons to press. RAD [48] is an accessible racing
game that relies on sonification to represent the speed of the
car and cues on the racetrack. Beyond appropriate interac-
tion techniques, an adaptation or simplification of gameplay
is necessary to make games accessible [4, 2]. In an educa-
tional context, games can help children to learn and develop
certain skills while playing [10, 38, 50, 52]. For example, in
Hungry Cat [10] VI children feed a cat by finding food in a
room. This was shown to help children develop spatial mental
maps. BraillePlay [38] helps players to learn Braille characters
through a mobile game. Wilkerson et al. [52] designed a game
to help blind children learn programming. However, these
games are not designed to be played with sighted players.
Robot Technologies for Visual Impairment
Robot technology has recently shown promise to support non-
visual interaction with interfaces and displays. For instance,
Guinness et al. developed the Haptic Video Player, which
presents videos using mobile robots to allow for annotation by
touching robots as they move over a touch screen [23]. Their
results showed that many online videos can be improved by
adding audio and tactile annotations, and that off-the-shelf
hardware can be re-purposed to enable multimodal accessible
video content. In the BotMap system, Ducasse et al. explored
how blind users could use maps and execute zooming func-
tions effectively while receiving tangible feedback through
mobile robots [16]. We build on this work of re-purposing
robot technology that is not necessarily designed with acces-
sibility in mind to develop an educational game that address
barriers to inclusive play experiences.
FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS
We started our investigation by addressing the first research
question: What challenges and barriers are there to inclusive
play experiences for visually impaired and sighted children
in mainstream schools? We held focus group discussions
with two sets of experts. First, with qualified teachers of vi-
sual impairments (QTVIs) from the local authority’s sensory
support services. Five QTVIs participated in the first focus
group discussion, which took place at the local offices. Each
QTVI works with up to 20 families and with local schools to
accompany the children through their education, to provide
one-to-one teaching sessions, and to train staff. We held the
second focus group discussion at a local inclusive school with
three teaching assistants (TAs) and the school’s special educa-
tion needs coordinator (SENCo). The school is a community
primary school covering ages 4 to 11 years. It has a dedicated
special educational needs resource base for disabled children,
including 5 visually impaired and blind children. Each child
has a dedicated TA who assists them on a one-to-one basis.
Discussions lasted around two hours. We presented our re-
search objectives then asked questions about challenges and
barriers to inclusive play in mainstream schools. We then
let participants drive the discussions as they described their
experiences. We recorded and transcribed the discussions. We
used a thematic analysis where one researcher produced initial
codes and labels of data segments, which we validated through
peer validation [1], where two researchers met regularly to
review and clarify coding and discuss themes.
Challenges and Barriers to Inclusive Play Experiences
Engineering Social Engagement
Participants acknowledged that visually impaired children,
particularly those with severe VIs, often require additional
support in developing and maintaining social engagement with
peers. They mentioned that inclusive schools implement ex-
plicit mechanisms to help children nurture social skills through
close TA supervision, and through social engineering schemes.
TAs interact closely with the children and they form strong
bonds. The roles of the TAs then involve not only adapting
learning materials and providing assistance during lessons, but
also supervising and regulating social encounters for children
in the playground and during other social times. TAs pointed
out a set of challenges that result from this close interaction;
namely that they must balance supervision with allowing space
for healthy social interactions: “children do an awful lot of
looking out of the windows, kicking each other under the table,
sniggering and giggling and all that, when the TA is there,
they can’t really be there as an adult and be seen to just ig-
nore this” (TA3). Practically, this means that “non-curricular”
social interaction is naturally reduced around TAs, and hence
children with VIs miss out on: “a lot of learning that goes
on with that [..] everything becomes mediated through adult
behaviour, which actually isn’t what [VI children] should be
experiencing” (QTVI4).
Participants mentioned alternative mechanisms, designed to
reduce dependence on adult supervision for social engage-
ment. For instance, a “buddy system” where sighted peers are
trained to “work with [VI children] each day, so [VI child]
knows she has someone to play with while she makes her own
friends” (SENCo). Another school uses a “friends bench”
in the playground, reserved for children who are looking for
someone to play with. This was mentioned as a good example
of inclusive provision, because anyone could sit on the bench
to look for a friend, not just disabled children. Despite these
engineered mechanisms, participants pointed out that there
was not enough support for inclusive play between children
with mixed visual abilities. That is, once VI children do find
sighted friends to play with or vice versa, there are not enough
options engendering engaging play experiences available to
them from that point forward.
Computer Games Accessibility and Pace
Computer games were mentioned as key for supporting en-
gagement among peers. Participants discussed how accessible
computer games provide an outlet for VI children and can
be a way for them to engage in what they dubbed “healthy
mischievous behaviour”: “it’s something for blind kids to be
a little naughty, I caught him playing an audio game while
wearing headphones when he was supposed to be using the
calculator!” (TA4). But participants pointed out that the VI-
specificity of these games could become a source of social
isolation and frustration: “lots of kids talk about the computer
games they’re playing, but [VI children] completely missed out
on that whole bit of social world” (QTVI2). One participant
highlighted that: “computer games specifically designed for
people with visual impairments are different from the sighted
games and also a lot of them are quite adult.” (QTVI4). There
are thus barriers to inclusive play experiences related, on the
one hand, to the accessibility of computer games and, on the
other, to social interactions that occur around computer games.
Pace of computer games was highlighted as one of the signif-
icant barriers to making them truly accessible and engaging
to both sighted and VI children: “say you’re playing a game
of snakes and ladders, and we’ve got tactile versions of that
game, the pace to play it is very slow, so the [sighted] children
are gonna get impatient especially young children” (TA3). In
gauging their views on the characteristics of games that could
be inclusive of both sighted and visually impaired children,
participants highlighted examples that involve hands-on ma-
nipulation and more emphasis on spoken narration, speaking
and listening: “one that works really well is [physical game’s
name] where you hold an object and you have to pull the right
part according to spoken instructions, that one does work for
everybody and [VI child] can keep up with the pace” (TA4).
However, even then such games might not be appropriate for
older children: “At seven you might get away with snakes and
ladders, but by the age of 15 you’re really not” (QTVI1).
Physical Education Accessibility and Pace
Physical education (PE) could be a natural place to develop
hands-on engaging play experiences for VI and sighted chil-
dren. But pace again posed a significant barrier to making PE
and playground games inclusive of VI children, particularly
when PE and playground activities involve team games: “if
you’re trying to be in a team game where you’re the only one
with a visual impairment then you can’t keep up with the pace”
(SENCo). A QTVI suggested that schools should be pushed
through legislation to adopt more accessible physical games:
“Goal ball is brilliant because it was devised for the visually
impaired, it’s quite slow paced, everyone is blindfolded, and
everyone can play it at the same level” (QTVI1). But here
too, participants mentioned potential issues with motivating
sighted children to take on such games. Participants also dis-
cussed structural and organisational issues that could stand in
the way of enforcing accessible and inclusive physical games
in schools: “a lot of schools now fund specialist PE coaches
to come, particularly in primary, some of those coaches are
ready to take [VI child] into account, others don’t, that’s hard
because the coaches are not members of the school staff so it
becomes very tricky” (QTVI3).
Independent Navigation and Mobility
Mobility is a core part of physical play activities. Participants
reflected on the way broader issues of independent mobility
could accumulate to constitute barriers to social engagement
and inclusive play. Learning how to move around the school
was described as: “a massive learning curve” (QTVI3) for
VI children, with significant time and effort required to reach
independence: “they usually start by learning mobility routes
a year before they even transfer [to a new school], and it can
take a year to actually learn the routes around because we
don’t want them to be reliant on an adult for getting around as
a guide” (SENCo). Most VI children receive mobility train-
ing from a dedicated mobility officer. Participants explained
that there is no specific technological support for this process:
“it’s just the cane and touch and an instructor, the instructor
sometimes makes Lego models to show where routes are on
the school” (QTVI1). Because significant effort is invested
in learning routes, VI children tend to stick to familiar routes,
which can lead to reduced opportunities for more adventur-
ous mobility that is key for serendipitous social encounters.
Some of these issues depend on the personality of the child
in question: “we have some children who are very bold and
confident and just go for it, others are terrified and just stay in
their safe base, and that’s an issue” (TA2). However, here too,
there seemed to be a tension between the general aim of reduc-
ing adult supervision and maintaining a safe environment for
the children: “because he’s taking his cane out into the play
ground, obviously there is a safety issue with that, so there is
always an adult there with him. Usually I go out at play time, I
try not to stay with him, but you kind of have to just check that
he’s alright” (TA3). Thus, a combined concern for hazardous
encounters and social isolation means that the potential for
dependency on adult supervision increases, especially at social
times, e.g. between lessons and during play time.

CO-DESIGN WORKSHOPS
We next ran co-design workshops to generate insights about
how to design an inclusive educational game that could address
some of the barriers outlined above. We aimed to address the
second research question: How can we co-design inclusive
play technologies with participants who have mixed visual
abilities? We worked with eight children (five male, 9-10 years,
5 VI, and 3 sighted “buddies”) and six adults (all female, 4 TAs,
and 1 SENCo). Due to other commitments, some children
only attended some of workshops (Table 1).
Workshop Procedure
We ran four co-design workshops on school premises during
normal school days. They lasted two hours each, two to three
weeks apart. Each workshop had a set of learning objectives
and a set of design objectives. Together these introduced de-
sign directions that gradually evolved to realise the broader
aim of generating insights about the design of a robot-based
inclusive educational game. All workshops had the same
structure: an introduction, a set of design activities, then a
showcase and discussion, mimicking typical lesson structures
at the school. The introduction and showcase/discussion in-
volved all participants. In the design activities, participants
worked in groups of four children and one to two TAs. The
SENCo and some of the TAs tended to move between groups.
We provided the TAs with activity sheets to help facilitate the
design activities. Two researchers ran the sessions and co-
designed with participants. A third researcher took notes and
kept time. Sessions were also video recorded. We obtained
written consent from parents, TAs and the SENCo, and verbal
assent from the children. This procedure was approved by the
Ethics Board at the authors’ institution.
We used off-the-shelf Ozobots (www.ozobot.com) because they
are an educational robotic product targeting the age range of
our child participants and have already been successfully used
on systems for VI people [23, 16]. They are designed to be
engaging to sighted children, and so have potential to address
some of the barriers identified in the focus group discussions.
Ozobots Bit are small (2.5cm diameter x 2.5cm high, 9 grams),
have two wheels and a color sensor. Users can control their
movement by two means: using coloured line drawings (e.g.
the robot will follow a line underneath it, color codes speed),
and using a visual programming language. They have an
approximate autonomy of 1h when moving.
Workshop 1: Introducing the Robots
As a learning objective, we aimed, in the first workshop, to
help participants understand what constitutes a robot technol-
ogy and to learn about the basic functionality of Ozobots. As
Figure 2. (A) Children applying coloured line codes to program robots’
speed in a basic robot racing game. (B) In Workshop 2, participants
played a space game where robots traverse the solar system and answer
trivia questions about planets. (C, D) In Workshop 4, participants built
a physical obstacle course in the classroom, a map to represent it and
used robot navigation to provide each other with instructions on how to
traverse the classroom in real-time.
a design objective, we wanted participants to reflect on the
extent to which Ozobots are accessible to VI children and to
design solutions to accessibility issues that they may identify.
We combined a variety of activities to achieve these objectives,
including listening to various robot audio recordings to gener-
ate discussions and reflections, handling Ozobots (four robots
per group), and low-fi multisensory crafting using a variant of
the multisensory box of stuff [34].
Outcomes: Audio recordings of robot sounds were effective
in getting the children to articulate and share their own un-
derstanding of what constitutes a robot and to think about
different forms robots could take, their tasks and where they
might be found. All Participants became familiar with switch-
ing Ozobots on and off and with the way they followed lines.
Participants discovered three accessibility issues: identifying
and differentiating between robots, accessing on/off buttons
and line drawings, and following the robots as they moved.
To address these issues, participants used multisensory crafts
to customise their robots with anthropomorphic features and
clothing items (Fig. 1). E.g. Romeo clothed his robot in a
woolly hat, Laila added sticky toffee scent on top of a sponge
hat, and Tom found it difficult to locate the on/off button, so he
augmented it with a rubber button. Robots could then be differ-
entiated by the way they felt and smelled, crafts could be used
as tactile trackers, allowing children to follow robots’ move-
ment by lightly placing a hand on top as it moved. For line
drawings accessibility, some children used scented pens and
craft threads to augment and replicate drawn lines. But a TA
discovered that tactile tape was the most effective means for
making robot paths accessible; they were easier to craft, trace
and, unlike threads, preserve Ozobots mobile functionality.
Workshop 2: Coding Robots and Initial Game Concepts
We next introduced participants to more advanced movement
control of the Ozobots. Because the visual programming lan-
guage is inaccessible to visually impaired people, we focused
on using coloured line drawings, and we engaged participants
in learning about controlling speed (slow/fast) and direction
(right/left) of the robots. In terms of design objectives, we
aimed to engage participants in thinking about practical appli-
cations for coding robots through two basic games; a racing
game where they race their robots to traverse a path at different
speeds; and a space game where they control the movements
and directions of their robots across the solar system and an-
swer trivia about different planets (Fig. 2 (B)). We chose
“space” as a theme because TAs suggested it matched chil-
dren’s ongoing curricular activities at the school.
Outcomes: Participants coded robots’ movements using a
combination of coloured pens and colour-coded labels. They
worked in pairs to race their robots, demonstrating understand-
ing of the codes explored in the workshop. They enjoyed the
competitive nature of the games and demonstrated curricu-
lum knowledge in the space game. Using colours to code the
robots remained inaccessible for the VI children, however, par-
ticularly for Peter and Laila, who had the most severe visual
impairments in the group and who had to rely on the assistance
of TAs and sighted buddies to get engaged in the coding pro-
cess. The children enjoyed the collaborative coding process
despite this. And although there was no focus on learning
outcomes in the workshop, the TAs commended the embed-
ding of learning objectives about space, which they used as an
opportunity to connect workshop activities to subject matters
relevant to the game, including history and design technology.
Workshop 3: Computational Thinking, Maps & Games
Having learned about the basic functionalities and coding of
robots in the first two workshops, the aim of the third work-
shop was to introduce participants to algorithms and com-
putational thinking, and because of the issues highlighted in
the focus group discussion around joint action, to develop
their joint map-making design skills using crafts, codes and
objects. We used role play, fiction and Lo-Fi crafting. Partic-
ipants created and impersonated their own robot characters,
they wore robot masks and chose a name, sound effect, and
a function/superpower for their robot character (Fig. 2 (C)).
They then worked in groups to break down a familiar task (e.g.
making a pizza or a smoothie) into a set of basic instructions,
and acted as robots to receive and execute these instructions
for completing the tasks. Next, participants designed a basic
game concept: to design a rescue map and a set of instructions
to guide a robot towards rescuing a stranded alien.
Outcomes: Participants created robot characters incorporating
multisensory features (e.g. sound, textures and scent) and
functions (e.g. a flying robot). The use of a familiar task was
effective in helping children think about how to breakdown a
complex task into basic tasks and devise instructions, and role
playing was effective in getting the children to observe the
importance of order and precision when executing each others
instructions. For example, Richard discovered that, as a robot,
he needed to both narrate what he was doing to give feedback
to those giving him instructions, and to compliment those
narrations with multisensory effects (e.g. mouthing sounds,
stomping feet) to help visually impaired peers. Children en-
joyed using multisensory craft materials to create maps for
their game concept. Maps had Lego bricks as bridges, tactile
and scented materials to represent obstacles (e.g. the scent of
the sea for sharks), tactile tape for routes and borders. We en-
countered technical problems with robots batteries not lasting
as long as the workshops, despite fully charging them. We
thus created a “charging station” that children took control of.
Workshop 4: Physical Courses
We aimed to build on the participants’ positive engagement
with role playing, map design and generating and executing
navigation instructions. The fourth workshop focused on ex-
ploring how participants could learn to apply these skills in the
design of a collective physical game about accessible naviga-
tion, and to complement this with opportunities to learn more
about team coordination. This workshop theme also ties back
to the issues of independent physical mobility and social in-
teraction that were highlighted in the focus group discussions.
Participants worked in groups to design a physical obstacle
course inside a classroom using a range of objects, e.g. sports
equipment, furniture, cushions and musical instruments. In
groups, they designed a map of the obstacle course, and then
swapped roles. One pair read the map using an Ozobot char-
acter to generate navigation instructions. The other executed
the instructions to traverse the obstacle course.
Outcomes: Participants used a variety of items to construct
their course, e.g. musical instruments to solve riddles, and
chairs to create tunnels. The TAs helped the children iterate
their designs by using a white cane to trial the accessibility of
the course, and children modified the course in response to TA
feedback; for example Laila and Caroline suggested hanging
bells on chairs to make directions more obvious. In general,
the children enjoyed the physical navigation component of the
game, and were all effective at generating and executing in-
structions and at traversing the course. With one of the groups,
we started to notice that Tom was finding it difficult to keep
track of map details. The complexity of the course, items on
the map and the pace at which Cian was traversing the course
made it difficult to read the map and generate instructions in
real-time. There were thus some issues with the complexity of
the objects used to populate maps, which led to joint thinking
between researchers and TAs about managing map content for
different groups of children. The TA in this case sketched a
simplified version of the map and printed it using swell paper,
and then modulated Cian’s pace to match Tom’s map reading
speed. This helped Tom read the map and generate instructions
more effectively (Fig. 2 (D)).
Inclusive Educational Game Design Guidelines
Six high level guidelines emerged from a high level analysis of
workshop data, including debriefing notes validated through
discussions and references to video data:
1. Incorporate multisensory feedback to equalise access and
meaning making: Given the mixed visual abilities that were
present, multisensory materials and feedback were key to
engage all participants in equally meaningful ways.
2. Include elements of crafting to promote joint action and
ownership of game content: Using crafting to customise robots
and design maps was an important and engaging element of
the workshops that both children and educators enjoyed. Often
crafting activities went on for much longer than planned and
the children took pride in showcasing the creations.
3. Distribute and share roles between players to widen per-
spectives and promote empathy: Giving all children the oppor-
tunity to take on and swap roles provided a means for shared
reflection and engaged discussions.
4. Use narration to moderate pace: Using narration to guide
design activities, describe non-verbal actions and share instruc-
tions was important to maintain a common pace for everyone.
Narration was also seen as a key component for making games
more inclusive.
5. Combine physical navigation and maps to increase engage-
ment and joint action: The children enjoyed both building
and traversing the obstacle course. Creating maps and shar-
ing instructions provided a means for focused and engaged
coordination and learning.
6. Embed learning objectives to match interests and promote
teacher control: Workshop activities were designed to be
engaging and to encourage creativity. Embedding learning
objective was also important for the educators, providing them
with a means for maintaining control and regulation.
GAME DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION
We then worked with professional game designers to design a
game concept using the guidelines. Eight people working in
games’ accessibility for visually impaired people participated
in the workshop lasting 80 minutes. designers were people
working in the design of accessible games at one of the au-
thors’ institution. They have experience mainly in interactive
board games (e.g. with tangibles, cards) with some of these
games targeted at children. We adopted the six-to-one method
[28]; generating six ideas and then developing one. After an
introduction, each participant had 10 minutes to generate six
ideas for the game. Then everyone presented their ideas for
criticism. This led to the proposal of a refined game concept.
Game plot and structure: An alien robot species wants to take
over the solar system and has kidnapped some of the planets.
Using an Ozobot as the protagonist, players are required to
travel through the solar system to check which planets have
been kidnapped and to rescue them. To prevent the alien
species from kidnapping further planets, players must reach
them and correctly answer questions about them. The game
had three interwoven parts: 1) moving robots on a Planet
Board (Fig. 3 (A)) to “travel across space” and trigger ques-
tions about the planetary system. All children planned and
crafted robot routes in this part; 2) exploring a Lego Naviga-
tion Map (Fig. 3 (B)) of the school to locate missing planets.
Here children swapped roles: navigators read the map and
generate instructions, rangers use the instructions to go and
retrieve the planet; and 3) going into the school to locate and
retrieve the planets (Fig.3 (C)).
Evaluation Workshop
We ran an evaluation workshop to examine the third research
question: In what way does the developed prototype support
inclusive play experiences? Three TAs and seven children
who also took part in previous workshops participated in the
Figure 3. The developed game: (A) the Planet Board where Ozobots

evaluation (Romeo could not attend). They were split into two
groups (four/three children and two/one TAs in each group)
and played the game from start to finish, lasting between 30
and 40 minutes. One TA played the role of a planet kidnapper,
instructed on where to go to hide kidnapped planets. One
researcher played the role of the game narrator, guiding the
children through play. Another researcher observed play, took
notes and kept time.
Data Collection & Analysis: We video recorded the sessions
and collected feedback from participants and conducted a
thematic analysis. We used a similar analysis process as be-
fore, with the exception of combining inductive and deductive
coding, focusing on behaviours indicative of collaborative
learning and participation. This is because these were seen
as particularly problematic for visually impaired and sighted
children in the focus group discussions and in prior work (e.g.
[5]). Additionally, collaborative learning is characterised by
behaviours we were interested to explore. Namely, social
processes regulating interactions among a small group of par-
ticipants as they work together to complete a problem-solving
task designed to promote engagement and learning [26]. The
deductive coding was based on Dillenbourg’s characterisa-
tion of collaborative learning [15] in terms of: shared goals;
interaction symmetry, and division of labour.
Outcomes
Five themes emerged from the above process: 1) negotiating
and executing shared goals; 2) symmetry of actions and knowl-
edge including TA control as a means for restoring symmetry;
3) peripheral learning opportunities and forms of explicit
and implicit learning 4) levels of division of labour; and 5)
Map-to-World and World-to-Map Transfers.
Negotiating and Executing Shared Goals
Children and TAs engaged in processes of jointly planning
and negotiating the execution of shared goals. This included
higher levels goals, e.g. rescuing a planet, as well as lower
level goals involving breaking down a challenge into smaller
tasks and solving them together. An example of the latter is
shown in the excerpt below. Here, the children were deciding
how to use tactile tape to draw a path for the robot:
Peter: can I have the tape there please [draws an imaginary line
with his index finger]
Caroline: yeah [cuts tape] I’m just going to cut that bit off
Peter: is it too long?
Meryem: [points to same area] yeh, measure it on there and
then leave an extra bit, maybe we can put it on later
Their exchange also shows how sighted children took care to
include the VI child in the execution of this goal, which is a
further goal they independently took upon themselves:
Caroline: right, I’m going to place it down, and Peter you can put
your finger where my finger is, see it? run it down the middle like that
[shows Peter how to run his finger over the tape]
Peter: [runs index finger over the tape]
Caroline: so now hopefully it should [places robot on tape]
Meryem: [points to the robot as it moves]
All: yay! [everyone applauds, robot arrives at target]
Symmetry of Actions, Knowledge and TA Control
Unlike the example above, however, there were instances
where sighted children were less inclined to include their VI
co-player in their joint planning and execution of shared goals.
This then created an asymmetry in the group’s locus of at-
tention and action. In an example of this, Cian and Richard
were deciding on how to outmaneuver an antagonist robot, Pe-
ter (who has a much more severe VI than Richard) remained
focused on the protagonist robot’s functionality, which was
irrelevant to the immediate focus of the children’s goal:
Narrator: 11 points, for 10 points I will grant you a flick action to flick
it off the board, for 5 points I will grant you a blocking wall
Cian: shall we just go around it
Richard: yup
Peter: ahh, it’s not working [lifts robot up and shakes it]
Richard: actually no
Cian: why? let’s go around it
Peter: [feels the previous tactile path] is it working now?
Cian: then we don’t have to use any points
Richard: erm [picks up the tactile tape]
Peter: [places the robot on the previous part of the
tactile route] it’s going, it’s going
Richard: [attempts to place the tape where Peter’s
hands are] Peter, excuse me
Cian and Richard’s actions and those of Peter are clearly asym-
metrical and misaligned here. Often, it was at points similar to
the one shown above that we observed explicit interventions
from the TAs to restore symmetry:
TA: Cian, tell Peter what you are doing
Cian: it’s fine
Peter: right [holds on the robot]
TA: Peter let Cian help
Cian: we need to save our points for that one [points to a faster
moving antagonist]
Peter: [lets robot go, tracks movement with his hand,
lifts a cup] I found a planet! [double taps the planet]
System: Jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar system, true or false?
Peter, Cian, Richard: [shout at the same time] true!
As a form of knowledge symmetry, we observed instances
where the children used the Q&A component of the game to
engage in conversation that realigns their beliefs about each
other’s knowledge. For example, by reflecting on common
experiences from other lessons, e.g.: “oh I know this! remem-
ber when we did planet research, I did all the planets and
how many moons they have, but I can’t remember” (Meryem);
neither can I! (Laila).
Peripheral Learning Opportunities
There were instances where other parts of the game seem
to afford other means for engaging in aligning knowledge
symmetry, mainly by creating opportunities for peripheral
learning and informal peer instruction. An example of this is
shown in the excerpt below in which Caroline helps Tom with
a conceptual framing, which was then re-enforced by the TA.
Here, Tom, Caroline and a TA are walking back through the
school corridor after retrieving a kidnapped planet:
Tom: [drops the planet] oh no
Caroline that’s alright [picks up the planet and hands it
back to Tom] there you go
Tom: it’s such a small planet. is that a real planet?
Caroline: it’s not a real planet [gestures circularly with her
hands] real planets are as big as the sky
Tom: this one fits in my hand
Caroline: [chuckles]
TA: planets are really big Tom [gestures with hands] and what
planet we are on? planet..
Tom: earth
TA: planet earth, good boy
Levels of Division of Labour
We observed two levels of division of labour during game play,
which occurred mostly on the Planet Board. In earlier parts of
the game, division of labour centred around crafting and was
driven by the sighted players who gave explicit instructions to
their VI co-players, e.g.:
Meryem: where are we? where is the Ozobot? it’s here by the black
planet, alright, so you find where the next bit is and I prepare the tape
Laila: [traces finger from current position and
locates the next destination]
Meryem: ok, I will now run the tape and you run your finger on it
[places tape] ready?
Laila: yeh, there [runs finger across the tape]
There were fewer exchanges of explicit instructions from
sighted children to regulate division of labour in later parts
of the game. Tasks became implicitly divided and closely
coupled, with symmetrical and smooth coordination of related
actions. Here is an example of such seemless labour division:
Cian: let’s do the final one
Richard: yes! We can go over [over the antagonist robot path]
Peter: [holds the two cups that designate the starting
and target points]
Cian: [prepares the tactile tape and places it down
near Peter’s left hand] this should be easy enough then
Richard: right, ready? [holds other end to launch robot]
Cian: wait I need to put more tape down
Peter: let me [grabs robot and positions it on the tape
with left hand, keeps right hand on destination cup]
Cian: [finishes taping the path] wait does this [the antagonist
robot] stay blocked?
Richard: yes, yes, yes
Peter: [follows robot by with left hand on top until
it reaches destination, shouts:] we found it!
Peter, Cian: [lift cup together and reveal the planet]
It is important to note that both explicit and implicit levels
of labour division centred around crafting and engaged both
sighted and VI children. This suggests that crafting, as cap-
tured by our design guidelines, was indeed an important game
element to incorporate, providing a means for joint locus of
attention and opportunities for group regulations of play.
Map-to-World and World-to-Map Transfers
We observed moments in play where children transferred ac-
tions and knowledge performed or obtained from one part of
the game onto another. We noted two types of transfer mech-
anisms in particular: transfers of non-verbal guiding actions;
and transfers of terminology to disambiguate navigation in-
structions. These transfers occurred between the game boards
and the school environment, and vice versa. The following
two excerpts show an example of transferring a non-verbal
guiding action from the Navigation Map to the school corridor.
Here Meryem uses tapping sounds to guide Laila:
Meryem: the front of the school is here [places Laila’s hands
at one end of the map] can you find the yellow block?
Laila: yellow block? [feels around with her hand]
Meryem: it’s on this huge [map] so it’s not jut going to be where you
are now [referring to where Laila has her hand]
Laila: That’s the front of the school [feels with her hand]
Meryem:[moves her hand near the location of the
yellow block and taps continuously on the table] it’s
closer to where I’m tapping, you’ll find it around there
Laila: oooh [moves hands and face toward the sound,
finds Meryem’s hand] there it is
The inclination to augment the environment with a guiding
sound appeared again when the same pair was walking through
the corridor. The tapping action was replaced with clapping,
but was used for a similar purpose; i.e. to use sound to guide
Laila towards a particular location. Here, Laila and Meryem
are walking back through the corridor having retrieved a kid-
napped planet. Tom and Caroline run towards them:
Caroline: did you find the planet?
Laila, Meryem: yes!
Caroline: wow, where was it?
Meryem: in the office, and apparently there is this song on the way
that goes tum tum ta tum ta tum
Laila: [laughs, misses a right turn]
Meryem: [laughs, stops and claps her hands
repeatedly] Laila come back!
Laila: [walks back and takes the right turn]
Meryem, Laila: [hold hands and sing the song heard in
the corridor] tum tum ta tum ta tum [both laugh]
The second type of transfers took a different form. In this case,
it was the terminology used to refer to landmarks and to for-
mulate navigational instructions that was transferred from the
Lego map to the corridor and vice versa, e.g.: “we’re coming
up to what he thought was the resource room, so now we have
to turn right” (Cian). This was thus an explicit transfer of
terminology across both environments and player roles, i.e.
a space ranger explicitly adopts the same terminology to in-
terpret navigation instructions in the real-world environment
as generated on the map by the navigator. In the following
example, we see a world-to-map terminology transfer, used to
resolve misinterpretation when reading the map:
Cian: [places his hand on Peter’s hands and moves it
back to the initial location] so that’s the library Peter and
[moves both their hands] and this is year one and reception
Richard: [retracts his hand, corrects Cian] wait that’s
first and that’s Mr (headteacher’s) office
Peter: is this Mr (headteacher’s) office?
Cian, Riochard: [move everyone’s hands to a location to
correct Peter’s interpretion] this is
Cian: and what’s this then [moves both his and Peter’s
hand to next location on the eamp] what’s besides Mr (head-
teacher’s) office?
Peter: the reception
Cian: so where do we need to go?
Peter: [jumps up and down, shouts] to the reception!
We thus observed an aptitude to use maps effectively, to appro-
priate modes of reading maps, and to apply navigation instruc-
tions in the real world. These aptitudes manifest equally in the
game play by both visually impaired and sighted children.
DISCUSSION
Approaches to the design of accessible games have tended to
focus on the specific functional needs of a target disability
user group. This can work against the objectives of promoting
inclusive play between disabled and non-disabled players. We
examined how we could address this challenge in the context
of designing an educational game inclusive of both visually
impaired and sighted children. We aimed to alleviate some
of the challenges and barriers which visually impaired chil-
dren meet in mainstream schools: around inclusive learning
experiences, social engagement and participation.
Discussions with education experts highlighted the need to
support visually impaired children in developing and main-
taining social engagement with their peers. We found that
focus on functional accessibility could impede social engage-
ment, and inclusive play as a vehicle for it, for example via
over-dependence on teaching assistants. We observed that this
gap manifests as a set of disconnects between VI and non VI
children, around pace and stimulation, across computer and
physical games: disconnects which also map onto broader
issues of independent mobility inside schools. This led us
to explore the use of robotic technology with basic mobility
functions as a basis for designing inclusive play experiences.
Inclusive Co-design Approach
Building on work on inclusive co-design [39, 35], we aimed to
emphasise inclusion, both in terms of the design process and
its outcomes. We achieved this by bringing together children
with and without visual impairments, alongside their educa-
tors, in a series of activities that provided opportunities for
learning about a robot technology, and about design, acces-
sibility and inclusion. An important starting point was our
decision to choose a technology which did not accentuate the
needs of a particular user group over another. The particular
robots we used helped in this regards. They are designed to
engage sighted children, but they have also been shown to pro-
vide functional accessibility to visually impaired adult users
[23, 16]. The workshops were thus an opportunity to learn
not just about robotic technology, but also about the ways in
which children with different visual abilities engage with, and
through, such a technology.
Our co-design approach was characterised by several impor-
tant elements: 1) we engaged participants with a mixed set
of visual abilities (visually impaired and sighted), age groups
(children, adults), and roles (pupils, teaching assistants and
designers), thus extending prior work that emphasised the im-
portance of including teachers of visual impairments in design
(e.g.[45, 21]). 2) We organised the workshops within school
premises, and modelled their structure to mimic typical lessons
familiar to the children, which provided a comfortable and
familiar environment. 3) We embedded learning objectives
so that children could both learn about the technology being
explored, and learn, through it, a subject matter (eg. space).
4) We shared facilitation roles with the educators, who were
present as both participants and supporters of the sessions, as
recommended by prior work in this area [34]. 5) We used a
blend of design methods, including multisensory materials,
role play and narration, based on insights from the focus group
discussions, and prior work on how to create a design space
that is equally engaging to all participants [18].
How Inclusive Play Experiences Were Nurtured
The focus groups and co-design workshops yielded a set of de-
sign guidelines for inclusive educational mobility games. The
game used Multisensory Feedback in the form of tangible inter-
actions and auditory feedback. Audio rendered the questions
in the game while tangible hands-on interactions supported
engagement and maintained a pace that was comfortable for
all players. For example, hiding planets on the board created
an equal sense of anticipation, reducing asymmetry between
players’ ability to overview the full play experience. The ben-
efits of multisensory feedback that we observed are consistent
with findings from prior work (e.g. [9, 49, 30, 14]). Crafting
was a crucial component, both helping children organise and
coordinate their work, and providing an opportunity for them
to learn how to be inclusive of each other, in terms of action
and pace. For example, we saw how crafting helped children
share and negotiate goals and move to more seamless and
inclusive division of labour. This engaged, collaborative, and
inclusive behaviour was also re-enforced by the guideline to
Distribute and Share Roles between Players, because it pro-
vided children with an opportunity to experience challenges in
play from various perspectives and to tailor their approach to
support each other accordingly. Finally, the use of Narration
was also crucial in ensuring the pace of play was comfortable
and engaging for all players. Pace was a recurring concern,
appearing in the focus group discussions, co-design activities,
and final evaluation. Spoken narration, targeting a common
modality of interaction provided anchor points to regulate the
pace of play when needed. This was particularly important to
help visually impaired children keep track of play, but also to
help sighted children maintain engagement and interest.
Withdrawing Robots
Combining Physical Navigation and Maps was an important
element to include in a mobility-centered game. In their feed-
back, children unanimously singled out going out into the
school to locate kidnapped planets as their favourite part of
the game. The robots did not figure at all in their feedback
about the play experience. This was unexpected, contrasting
to the design workshops where we observed children’s attach-
ment to the robots (e.g. creating customised characters and
asking to work with their own robots in each workshop, and
in Tom’s case, always physically holding on to his robot). It is
therefore interesting that once embedded in a physical game,
the robot technology withdrew and was no longer the focus
of engagement between the children. In considering the shift
from functional accessibility to inclusive interaction, the above
observation points to a novel use of robot technology for acces-
sible interaction, which contrasts prior work involving these
specific types of robot [16, 23], and in which the technology
remained in the foreground of accessible interaction.
Physical Navigation and Spatial Cognition
During play, children combined and appropriated different
modes of map reading and applied navigation instructions ef-
fectively in the real world. The most striking manifestation of
these aptitudes was in the way children transferred navigation
actions and knowledge across the static and mobile aspects of
the game. These observations confirm existing results about
transfer of spatial knowledge between maps and real setting
for visually impaired adults and children [27]. For example,
following an audio-based game play of building explorations,
young people with visual impairments constructed accurate
mental representations of the building [13]. Our findings also
confirm exploratory approaches to supporting blind navigation
through embedded multisensory feedback [19, 34, 25, 11],
and point to the potential of using games of this sort to design
inclusive technologies for blind collaborative navigation. As
a starting point, we envision further studies to characterise a
design space that leverages and supports the various types of
transfers that helped the children maintain efficiency and en-
gagement during collaborative spatial navigation. In our case,
these included different action transfers e.g. guiding actions
and terminology, occurring across navigation environments
(static and mobile) and across roles (rangers and navigators).
Broader implications on Inclusive Education
A further design guideline that emerged from the workshops
is the importance of embedding learning objectives. While
this might seem trivial for educational games, we note that the
design process and final play experience it produced afforded
four layers of learning: Firstly, play experiences should allow
children to engage in content-based learning, e.g. to learn
about a particular subject matter like space. Secondly, to en-
gage critically with technical aspects of the gaming material.
In our case this was the accompanying computational think-
ing and its application to generating and executing navigation
instructions. Thirdly, children should be engaged in design
thinking, for example crafting customisation, designing phys-
ical courses and maps. Finally, and most importantly, they
should learn about inclusion itself, how to consider each oth-
ers needs, abilities, concerns and perspectives. Engaging with
peers in this way provides an opportunity to demystify miscon-
ception about disabilities, e.g. showing that there are methods
to explore the world other than relying on vision. This is thus
an important dimension of learning that inclusive educational
games in schools should aim to target. Inclusive educational
games then can leverage the advantage of inclusive schools to
nurture a space for sighted children to learn about disabilities.
This expands on the concept of inclusive education beyond
children working together to achieve equal learning outcomes
[37]. Educational experiences, and play as a vehicle for that,
should provide visually impaired children with an opportunity
to lead in how visual impairment is shared with other people.
LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK
We evaluated the game with the same children who contributed
to its design. The co-design workshops produced high level
guidelines, and so the resulting game concept and mechanics
were in effect novel to the children involved. There is also
value in involving the children designers in the final evaluation,
particularly for an inclusive design approach: The children
expected to see a full game at the end of the process, it was
important to fulfil this expectation, and evaluating it also meant
that the children not only experienced the game they took part
in designing, but were also empowered in gaining a sense of
ownership over the resulting technology. Despite this, future
work should also include other children in order to provide
further validation for the design guidelines. Furthermore, the
focus of the evaluation was on improving inclusion in terms
of learning experience rather than knowledge acquisition, and
in this sense was limited by not measuring learning outcomes.
Future work should also evaluate learning outcomes.
CONCLUSION
We used a co-design approach to design and evaluate an robot-
based educational game that is inclusive of both visually im-
paired and sighted children. Our work addresses the challenge
of shifting design emphasis from functional accessibility to
inclusion, in order to cater for both disabled and non-disabled
children in the context of inclusive mainstream education. We
presented a set of co-design explorations that helped us gener-
ated a set of design guidelines for inclusive play experiences,
using robot technology for spatial navigation and mobility.
Our guidelines emphasise multisensory feedback, hands-on
creation, and narration as a means for modulating pace and
stimulation; all of which were highlighted as potential barriers
to inclusive interactions. Our evaluation demonstrated how
emphasis on inclusive experience led to a gradual withdrawal
of the robot technology to the background of the experience. It
also highlighted the importance of considering complex layers
of learning when designing inclusive educational games for
visually impaired and sighted children.
