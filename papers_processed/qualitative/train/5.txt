ABSTRACT
Customised avatars are a powerful tool to increase iden-
tification, engagement and intrinsic motivation in digi-
tal games. We investigated the effects of customisation
in a self-competitive VR exergame by modelling players
and their previous performance in the game with cus-
tomised avatars. In a first study we found that, sim-
ilar to non-exertion games, customisation significantly
increased identification and intrinsic motivation, as well
as physical performance in the exergame. In a second
study we identified a more complex relationship with the
customisation style: idealised avatars increased wishful
identification but decreased exergame performance com-
pared to realistic avatars. In a third study, we found that
‘enhancing’ realistic avatars with idealised characteris-
tics increased wishful identification, but did not have any
adverse effects. We discuss the findings based on feed-
forward and self-determination theory, proposing notions
of intrinsic identification (fostering a sense of self) and
extrinsic identification (drawing away from the self) to
explain the results.

INTRODUCTION
Many people struggle to meet the recommended lev-
els of physical activity [49], with 40-65% of those who
begin exercise regimes dropping out within 3-6 months
[5]. Introducing digital game elements into exercise con-
texts to create exergames is a promising approach that
aims to combat the failure to meet these recommenda-
tions and the related rise in global obesity levels [122,
119]. Combining exergames with virtual reality (VR)
has revolutionised the possibilities for health interven-
tions, creating an immersive experience with possible at-
tentional distraction from physical exertion [54, 137, 73].
These virtual interventions can increase intrinsic moti-
vation and participation across a range of demographic
populations, including adults, children and people with
disabilities [10, 56, 137, 22].
A player’s encounter with VR exergaming can be an im-
mersive and embodied experience, and at its core lies the
player’s identity [108]. With recent advancements in VR
technology, the player experience of virtual worlds can
be more immersive than ever before, blurring the bound-
aries to reality and making it easier for players to develop
virtual identities [85]. At the heart of the immersed sense
of identity is the player avatar: a unique character cus-
tomised by the player with traits and physiognomies that
resemble the player, or in some cases are idealised [124].
In non-exertion games, identification with an avatar has
been found to increase intrinsic motivation, flow state,
self-presence and self-esteem, and motivate the player
to improve their game performance [14, 17, 84, 127, 73,
116, 131, 18, 73, 33]. There is also some evidence that
avatars in non-VR, low-to-medium-intensity exergames
have similar benefits for the player experience [56, 100]
and can improve exercise intention [71, 66], in particu-
lar with idealised avatars able to lower social physique
1
anxiety [115], increase perceived interactivity [58] and
motivate exercise [96, 95, 72]. However, it is not known
how customised avatars affect the player experience in
immersive VR exergames, and in particular, how they
affect a player’s physical performance in exergames de-
signed to challenge the player with a high physical in-
tensity [57]. Furthermore, it is unknown how realistic
vs. idealised avatar styles affect player experience and
performance in such exergames.
In this paper we address these gaps in the literature by
studying the effects of avatar customisation and iden-
tification on the player experience and physical perfor-
mance in a high-intensity VR exergame. We shed light
on whether avatar customisation in such exergames can
provide similar benefits as in non-exertion and non-VR
low-to-medium exertion games, and consider also, for the
first time, how different styles of customisation affect
identification and the resulting exergaming experience.
We address the following research questions:
RQ1 How does avatar customisation in a VR exergame
affect the player experience?
RQ2 Can player-avatar identification improve physical
performance in an exergame?
RQ3 Do different styles of customisation affect player
experience and performance differently?
To answer these questions, we conducted three studies
where participants customised different types of avatars
and then used them in a self-competitive exercycle-based
VR exergame. To address RQ3, each study investigated
the effects of a particular avatar style on player experi-
ence (RQ1) and physical performance in terms of power
output (RQ2): Study 1 compared generic avatars with
customised, realistic avatars; Study 2 compared the same
realistic avatars with idealised avatars representing play-
ers’ desired appearances; and Study 3 compared realistic
avatars with avatars that were enhanced in a hypothet-
ical but realistic manner, based on a player’s exercise
goals. We make the following contributions:
1. Empirical evidence that avatar customisation can im-
prove identification, player experience and physical
performance in a high-intensity VR exergame.
2. Results showing how different styles of avatars, from
realistic to idealised, can affect player experience and
physical performance in different ways.
RELATED WORK
Identification: The process of identification allows a
person to replace their identity with that of a charac-
ter, causing the individual to lose their usual sense of
self-awareness and temporarily become the character [26,
50]. The driving factor for identification is commonly at-
tributed to similarity, which assists individuals in imag-
ining themselves as the character portrayed [26, 127, 131,
73]. This similarity extends beyond simple demographics
and also includes attitudes, beliefs, experiences and be-
haviour [26, 127, 116]. In the context of virtual worlds
such as games, the player is represented as an avatar,
which acts as a virtual embodiment of the player’s iden-
tity and visually represents the player’s interactions [80].
Such presenting of oneself to others is regarded as an es-
sential human interaction [45] and an integral part of the
human experience [132]. During play the virtual body
of the avatar can become an extension of the real body
to create an embodied experience [74]. In order to facil-
itate identification through similarity and enable play-
ers to develop a stronger cyber-identity, modern virtual
worlds allow players to create customised avatars [124,
108, 85]. The means used to create and personalise these
avatars differ greatly across virtual worlds, which results
in a high degree of avatar variability depending on the
system and context in which it is created [33]. Players
customise visible and easily recognisable body features
such as hair style and eye colouring. Clothing is also an
important feature of customisation as it is intrinsically
linked to identity and the way we present ourselves to
others [93]. Clothing can enhance self-perception and
influence behaviour as it is representational of one’s per-
sonality [62], with many people spending real money on
virtual clothing and accessories in games such as Second
Life [24, 16].
Measurement: Avatar identification is an elusive con-
cept and measures of it are usually dependent on a par-
ticular context, e.g. MMORPGs. The first widely ac-
cepted measurement scale was the Player-Identification
Scale (PIS) [131] by Van Looy et al., which defines avatar
identification as a second order factor consisting of sim-
ilarity identification, wishful identification and embod-
ied presence. Van Looy et al. applied the PIS in a
MMORPG community and reported a positive associ-
ation between avatar identification and role play, cus-
tomisation and escapism. The Player-Avatar Identity
Scale (PAIS) by Li et al. [73] comprises four main factors:
feelings during play, absorption during play, positive at-
titudes toward the avatar, and importance of the avatar
to one’s self-identity. It was created by adapting a scale
for the identification of audiences with media characters
by Cohen [26] to the context of video games. The Player-
Avatar Interaction (PAX) scale by Banks and Bowman
[9] includes four factors – emotional investment, anthro-
pomorphic autonomy, suspensions of disbelief and sense
of player control – to define the perceived social and func-
tional association between player and avatar. It merges
theoretically divergent approaches – character attach-
ment [70] and player-avatar sociality [8] – to measure
dimensions of player-avatar relationships.
Idealised Avatars: Similarity is not the only factor
when creating and identifying with an avatar. The mir-
ror hypothesis [23] claims that people relate favourably
to characters who are either like themselves (the “mir-
ror”), or who represent their ideal self (the “magic mir-
ror”). The magic mirror concept, or wishful identifica-
tion, conflicts with claims that identification occurs only
through true player-avatar similarity [127, 134, 17, 116]
but has received support in recent literature [121, 65,
131]. The proposal is that players who customise and
2
fantasise about their avatar so that it more closely fits
their ideal self-image should also identify with it more
strongly. Ducheneaut et al. [33] investigated the per-
sonal attachment users have to their online identity and
revealed a tendency for users to embody aspects of their
enhanced or ideal self into their avatar. There was a bias
of avatar creation toward Western ideals, and older play-
ers, those with a higher body mass index, and players
with lower psychological well-being were more likely to
represent themselves in an idealised way [33, 14], which
reduced avatar diversity.
Effects of Customised Avatars: Avatar-based cus-
tomisation has been shown to positively affect avatar
identification [127, 133, 17, 139] and user experience
[127, 128, 116, 17]. While a player’s characteristics are
typically reflected in her avatar, researchers have also ob-
served influences of the avatar on the player: the Proteus
effect describes changes in player behaviour that con-
form with a player’s avatar [136]. For example, individ-
uals whose avatars engaged in healthy behaviours were
found to be more likely to engage in physical activities
in the real world [28], and watching one’s realistic avatar
lose weight as a reward for activity, or gain weight as
a punishment for inactivity, led participants to exercise
more [39]. Avatar customisation can enhance learning
in virtual environments [90] and can help to personalise
risk messages and transform attitude into behavioural
change [94]. Players’ avatars can elicit stereotypical or
compensatory in-game behaviours [7, 97, 130] and in-
fluence their satisfaction with online relationships and
their offline appearance and health [13, 68]. Further-
more, avatars can motivate non-exertion game players
to improve engagement and performance [17, 127, 18].
Effects of Idealised Avatars: Players who created
idealised avatars were consequently more satisfied and
more attached to their avatars [33] and felt greater
avatar-self connection [60]. ‘Superhero’ avatars were
shown to motivate pro-social behaviour [102, 138] in the
real world, ‘creative’ avatars increased creativity [46],
and avatars perceived as more appropriate for a musical
task led to increased musical performance [64]. Despite
all these positive results, idealised avatars also bear po-
tential risks. Self-discrepancy theory states that compar-
isons with your ideal self can lead to feelings of uneasi-
ness and dissatisfaction with your actual self [51]. Neg-
ative self-perception of our bodies has been associated
with depression, mental health disorders and inactivity
[4], e.g. a video game emphasising an unrealistic male
body ideal was found to have a negative impact on body
satisfaction [123]. Women are more likely to encounter
body dissatisfaction than men [21], particularly with the
prevalence of celebrity culture and social sites such as
Instagram depicting idealised and sexualised images of
women. High exposure to such media can lead to de-
creased motivation and negative emotional states [62].
Exergames: Avatars in exergames have been used
to investigate the role of self-construal on exercise in-
tentions and self-presence [59]. Customised exergame
avatars elicited more psychophysiological reponses com-
pared to generic avatars [100]. Avatars improved identifi-
cation, presence, enjoyment, activity and exercise inten-
tion [71, 66], and lowered social physique anxiety for peo-
ple with body image dissatisfaction [115]. Customising
idealised avatars was found to increase perceived inter-
activity and affect immersion in different ways depend-
ing on previous priming [58]. Exergame players with a
normal-weight avatar were more physically active and
more motivated to exercise than those using an obese
avatar [96, 95, 72]. Giving an avatar idealised capa-
bilities by augmenting an avatar’s running speed and
jumping height in a VR exergame also led to increased
intrinsic motivation and perceived competence [56].
STUDY 1: GENERIC VS. REALISTIC AVATARS
We investigated the effect of customised, realistic avatars
on player experience (RQ1) and performance (RQ2) in
a VR exergame by comparing them with generic, ‘Lego-
like’ avatars. Avatars are hardly visible if seen only from
the typical first-person perspective of a VR exergame
[19, 114]; therefore, we chose a self-competitive VR ex-
ergame [10] where the player would race against their
recorded previous gameplay performance, represented by
their avatar in a third-person perspective, in addition to
embodying their avatar directly from the typical first-
person perspective. This design was chosen to allow
participants to fully see their avatar during gameplay
as a ‘ghost’ of their own previous performance, mak-
ing the player’s avatar a more natural and immersive
part of the exergame, as a third-person perspective has
been shown to elicit more pronounced effects of custom
avatars compared to a first-person perspective [75]. We
used a within-participants design to investigate the ef-
fects of the independent variable avatar type with lev-
els: baseline (B), generic avatar (G), and realistic avatar
(R). All participants started with the baseline B, where
they embodied the generic avatar and no ‘ghost’ avatar
was shown; this served to create a ‘self-model’ of their
gameplay performance to be used in the following con-
ditions. Then, participants competed against their self-
model twice: once represented with a generic avatar (G)
and once with their realistic avatar (R). In each condi-
tion, the respective avatar was also used to embody the
player from the first-person perspective. The order of G
and R was counterbalanced.
Avatar Customisation
An off-the-shelf software tool for video game character
design, Autodesk Character Generator, was used to cre-
ate each avatar. The tool provides an interface for the
design of avatars based on blendshapes, i.e. pre-defined
body shapes that can be combined to adjust face and
body design (Fig. 2). Participants were given guidance
on how to customise a base character to make an avatar
in their own likeness by choosing the character sex (male
or female), face shape (by blending two faces together),
facial features including eye, mouth and nose shape,
body shape (by blending two body shapes together), skin

tone, hairstyle, hair colour and eye colour. Finally, par-
ticipants were given a choice of garments for the top
half and lower half, plus a choice of shoes. Following the
guidelines from Ducheneaut et al. [33], particular empha-
sis was given to more visible and recognisable features,
such as hair, clothing and body shape, in order to facil-
itate identification. Although the session was intended
as an individual task, several participants sought advice
from the researcher about elements of their appearance
and were comfortable discussing different aspects of their
bodies. In order to mitigate bias [1, 86] we took care to
engage with participants in a friendly, non-judgemental
atmosphere, emphasising anonymity and that authen-
tic answers would be most helpful. Each avatar design
session took 30-60 minutes, enabling the participants to
engage effectively in the customisation process.
Exergame
The exergame was played by riding a Lode Excalibur
Sport stationary exercycle while wearing an HTC Vive
head-mounted display (HMD) (Fig. 1d & 1e). The game
was very similar in appearance and functionality to the
game used by Barathi et al. [10]: players raced along a
straight road, with speed controlled by the exercycle and
lateral movements controlled by head tilt. To make the
gameplay more interesting, trucks moved slowly on the
road, which the player could avoid, although collisions
did not have any consequence. The game implemented
a 5-minute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) pro-
tocol with two high-intensity sprints: 60 sec warm-up,
30 sec sprint, 90 sec recovery, 30 sec sprint, 90 sec cool-
down. The protocol was based on ACSM guidelines for
exercise [89] and was also used by Barathi et al. [10].
We chose HIIT because of its benefits in reducing ex-
ercise time [42], motivating participants [126, 11] and
delivering health outcomes [69, 87, 43]. During warm-
up, recovery and cool-down, a daytime scene was shown,
with bright colours to evoke a relaxing atmosphere. Dur-
ing the sprints, a nighttime scene was shown with cars
following the player, evoking a sense of urgency. For the
warm-up, recovery and cool-down phases, we instructed
participants to cycle at a low cadence, between 65 and
70 RPM, using a fixed low resistance of 12 Nm. Follow-
ing HIIT protocols [55, 10], resistance during sprints was
initially set to 0.4 Nm kg−1
based on body mass. It was
then adjusted, if necessary, in a familiarisation phase to
enable participants to perform at a “very hard” rate of
perceived exertion (RPE) during sprints while avoiding
uncontrolled movements due to high cadence. The ex-
ergame was designed to record a player’s gameplay in
the baseline condition B, thereby creating a ‘self-model’
of the player, and playing it back during the other condi-
tions in the form of a third-person ‘ghost’ avatar. In or-
der to make the gameplay physically challenging and elu-
cidate performance differences in the avatar conditions,
the exercycle resistance was increased during sprints by
20% in G and R, compared to baseline B. The player
and the ‘ghost’ avatars started each sprint beside each
other to ensure fair self-competition.
Outcome Variables
Player-avatar identification was measured by combining
validated subscales that were suitable for use in a VR
exergame from the aforementioned Player-Identification
Scale (PIS) [131], Player-Avatar Identification Scale
(PAIS) [73] and Player-Avatar Interaction Scale (PAX)
[9] identification scales. The resulting new questionnaire,
which we refer to in the following as Player-Avatar Iden-
tification for Exergaming (PAIE), combines the similar-
ity identification (our main measure of identification),
wishful identification and embodied presence subscales
from PIS, the absorption during play and importance
to identity subscales from PAIS, and the emotional in-
vestment and sense of control subscales from PAX. The
other subscales are geared towards MMORPGs and are
not suitable for our exergame. Heart rate (HR) was
recorded in each condition as a measure of exertion using
a Polar A300 fitness monitor. We estimated maximum
HR based on ACSM guidelines [89], calculated as 220
minus age. We then calculated Peak HR% as the aver-
age of the peak HR of the two sprints, as percentage of
maximum HR. Performance for each of the three exper-
imental conditions was quantified using average power
output in Watts (W) over both sprints measured by the
exercycle. In order to compensate for individual differ-
ences in performance, we considered ∆Power, which is
a participant’s difference in average power output from
any of the other conditions to their baseline B. We used
the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) [104], which
has been used and validated in sport and exercise stud-
ies [78, 25], to measure intrinsic motivation with the
central Interest/Enjoyment subscale as our main mea-
sure of intrinsic motivation. We included also the sec-
ondary Effort/Importance, Perceived Competence, and
Pressure/Tension subscales. Flow was measured using
the Positive Psychology Lab’s Flow State Questionnaire
(FSQ) [76], with both its subscales: Balance of Chal-
lenges and Skills, and Absorption in the Task.

Procedure
Participants were screened using the Physical Activity
Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [125]. If there were
no health concerns, participants were then asked to com-
plete a demographics questionnaire and the International
Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [48], which esti-
mates general physical activity. Afterwards participants
created their own avatars in a guided customisation ses-
sion, as previously described. The customisation process
was led by the participant and aimed to create an avatar
that was a realistic representation of their true appear-
ance. Once the avatar was created, pictures of the avatar
were emailed to the participant in conjunction with the
PAIE indentification questionnaire to complete.
In the following exergaming session, participants were
informed about the VR exergame, that they would com-
pete against the recorded self-model of their baseline per-
formance, and that the sprint resistance would change.
Participants performed a familiarisation phase to expe-
rience the gameplay, understand the exercise and adjust
the sprint resistance to the appropriate level. Partici-
pants then played the game in the baseline condition (B),
with instructions to work ‘very hard’ during the sprint
phases. In the following conditions, participants played
the exergame again with the generic (G) and realistic
(R) avatars as self-competitors, with sprint resistance
increased by 20% so that players had to work harder to
keep up with their recorded baseline performance.
At the beginning of each condition, participants were
shown a full 3D view of the avatar that would embody
both their ‘ghost’ and themselves in order to mitigate the
impact of the partially obscured seating position on iden-
tification during gameplay. At the end of each condition
participants were asked to complete the PAIE, IMI and
FSQ questionnaires and provide qualitative comments
regarding their experience with that avatar. Participants
had a rest of 15 minutes between conditions to mitigate
fatigue. The entire experiment (avatar creation to exer-
cise completion) took approximately 120-150 minutes.
Hypotheses
Based on related work on avatars [71, 66] and pilot trials,
we posed the following a-priori hypotheses:
H1 Players identify more with realistic avatars (R) com-
pared to the baseline (B) without third-person avatar.
H2 Players identify more with their customised avatar
(R) than the generic avatar (G).
H3 Intrinsic motivation is higher with a realistic avatar
(R) compared to the generic avatar (G).
H4 Performance is higher with a realistic avatar (R)
compared to the generic avatar (G).
Participants
We recruited 15 participants (9 male, 6 female, age 20-
46) through personal communication and mailing lists.
The participants were mostly students and staff of the
University of Bath. The IPAQ classified 10 as HEPA
Active, 4 as Minimally Active, and one as Inactive.
Figure 3. Realistic (left) and idealised (right) avatars.
Qualitative Results
Examples of the realistic avatars are shown on the left
of Fig. 3. During the customisation process, we found
that five of the female participants wanted to discuss
aspects of their avatar’s characteristics, speaking aloud
as they were designing. The women were highly expres-
sive about the aspects of their own physical body they
would like to change (“my thighs are much larger than
that”, “my nose is more prominent”). Five of the six
female participants made their avatars noticeably larger
than they were in reality. By contrast, the male par-
ticipants appeared more confident describing their phys-
icality, and especially highlighted features that they liked
about themselves, e.g. one participant spent well over 10
minutes trying to get the right eye colour match (“I like
my blue eyes, they are a strong feature, in my family the
blue eyes are dominant”). The male participants also
stated more frequently that their customised avatar was
more authentic to their actual body image, with many
giving positive statements about their physique (“I have
been working out lately and my body has changed, so I
need to find an avatar build slightly muscular, I am happy
with how I look now”). Participants spent considerable
time choosing the right wardrobe and described this as
one of the most important customisable features, as it
brought the avatar to life and expressed an important
part of their individuality. All participants preferred
their custom avatar compared to the generic one. After
playing the exergame, all participants noted an increase
in enjoyment between the baseline and the avatar con-
ditions. Enjoyment was further increased with greater
avatar similarity (“Better to look at and improved the
gaming experience knowing I created it myself”). The
increased similarity also motivated them to try harder
(“It felt like I had more of an incentive to succeed as my
avatar’s achievements were reflective of my own. Also,
it made the game more immersive and made me more
competitive to beat my previous time”).

and realistic (R) avatars.
Quantitative Results
Results are shown in the upper section of Table 1 and in
Figure 4. All graphs show means with 95% confidence
intervals. We used paired t-tests – two-tailed if there
was no directed hypothesis and one-tailed if there was.
According to a power analysis, the latter were able to
detect medium-sized effects (Cohen’s d=0.68) between
conditions at α = 0.05 with a power of 0.8.
PAIE questionnaire analysis only considered responses
taken after each test condition in order to closely reflect
the identification players felt during gameplay. Similar-
ity Identification (Fig. 4 top left), Wishful Identification,
Importance to Identify and Emotional Investment were
all significantly higher with realistic avatars (R) com-
pared to the baseline (B) without third-person avatar
(t(15) ≥ 2.133, p ≤ .026), so we accept H1. The dif-
ferences in these identification measures between base-
line (B) and generic avatar (G) were not significant
(t(15) ≤ 1.658, p ≥ .120). Similarity Identification,
Wishful Identification, Importance to Identify and Emo-
tional Investment were all significantly higher for the re-
alistic avatars (R) compared to the generic avatars (G)
(t(15) ≥ 2.348, p ≤ .017), therefore we accept H2. In-
terest/Enjoyment was significantly higher (Fig. 4 bot-
tom left) for the realistic avatars (R) compared to the
generic avatars (G) (t(15) = 2.102, p = .027), with a
‘medium’ effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.543), so we accept
H3. FSQ Absorption was significantly higher (Fig. 4
bottom right) for the realistic avatars (R) compared to
the generic avatars (G) (t(15) = 3.287, p = .003), with
a ‘large’ effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.849). FSQ Balance
was also higher for R compared to G, but the difference
was not significant (t(15) = 0.737, p = .237). Peak HR%
was on average above 80 in all conditions, which indi-
cates that participants were exercising to the required
intensity for HIIT [89]. ∆Power was significantly higher
(Fig. 4 top right) for realistic (R) compared to generic
avatars (G) (t(15) = 2.428, p = .015), with a ‘medium’
effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.627), so we accept H4.

STUDY 2: REALISTIC VS. IDEALISED AVATARS
Our second study followed on from our first to investigate
how different styles of customisation affect identification,
user experience and performance (RQ3). Participants
created a realistic and an idealised avatar of themselves.
Similar to Study 1, we used a within-participants de-
sign for the independent variable avatar type with levels:
baseline (B), realistic avatar (R) and idealised avatar (I).
We compared the effects of a realistic avatar style (R) vs.
an idealised avatar style (I). The procedure for Study 2
was identical to that for Study 1, with the key difference
that two avatars were created during the avatar design
session and that, during the exercise session, the generic
avatar condition (G) was replaced by the idealised avatar
condition (I). We asked participants to create a character
that embodied their idealised view of themselves, taking
their realistic avatar as a basis. Participants were en-
couraged to create an avatar that “should reflect not the
reality, but your dreams and wishes of how you would
like to look – even if it is just for a day.” The process of
creating an idealised avatar based on an existing realistic
avatar took 15-20 minutes.
Hypotheses
Based on pilot study results and identification theory
[131, 73, 51], we posed the following hypotheses:
H5 Wishful identification will be higher for idealised
avatars (I) than realistic avatars (R).
H6 Performance will be lower for idealised avatars (I)
than realistic avatars (R).
Participants
We recruited 16 participants (11 male, 5 female, age 21-
75) similar to Study 1. Eight of them also participated
in Study 1. The IPAQ classified 13 as HEPA Active, one
as Minimally Active, and one as Inactive.
Qualitative Results
Female participants tended to give their idealised char-
acter a slimmer build while male participants tended to-
ward a more muscular avatar physique. Around half of
the participants changed eye and skin colour, while all
participants changed hairstyles. All participants modi-
fied their realistic avatar toward Western ideals, which
is consistent with related work [33]. By these standards,
participants preferred to make avatars that look more at-
tractive and fitter and stand out more. Despite a reduc-
tion in similarity, twelve participants noted a preference
for their ideal avatar (“I liked that I could be a super-
hero in the game”). Notably, our two oldest participants
(both in their 70s, one female), who were not familiar
with computer games and VR, commented that both
their avatars appeared “lifeless” and had an “unfamil-
iar, creepy” impression on them, similar to the uncanny
valley effect [81].

condition R to condition I (t(15) = 3.373, p = .002)
with a ‘large’ effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.843), so we
accept H5. None of the other identification subscales
showed significant differences between R and I (|t(15)| ≤
1.286, p ≥ .218). No significant differences were found
for any of the IMI and FSQ measures between R and I
(|t(15)| ≤ 1.461, p ≥ .165). There was a significant de-
crease in average power output (Fig. 5 right) for I com-
pared to R (t(15) = 1.779, p = .048) with a ‘medium’
effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.445), so we accept H6.
STUDY 3: REALISTICALLY ENHANCED AVATARS
The previous studies show that realistic and idealistic
avatars are different in their effects on exergame play-
ers. A natural question is whether there is a middle
ground: what happens if we enhance realistic avatars in
a way that makes them more idealistic, but still within
the realm of what is realistically achievable? Could this
motivate players to try harder? We investigate this in
a third study which compares a baseline (B), a realis-
tic avatar (R), and two different realistically enhanced
avatars (E1 and E6) using a within-participant design.
The enhanced avatars are a progression between the re-
alistic and idealistic avatars of a player (Figure 6). The
7
first enhanced avatar (E1) represents the player after one
month assuming they led a healthy lifestyle and com-
pleted regular exercise according to their exercise goals.
Similarly, the second enhanced avatar (E6) represents
the player after 6 months on the same trajectory. The
methodology is analogous to that of the two previous
studies, with the addition of the enhanced avatars.
Enhanced Avatar Design
The hypothetical points in the future for the enhanced
avatars were chosen based on experiences and empiri-
cal data about the way a person’s body shape typically
changes under the influence of healthy diet and exercise.
Based on typical weight loss from diet and exercise [135,
103, 118] and muscle development from resistance train-
ing [117, 110, 112, 79], body shape changes typically
become apparent after one month and are clearly visible
after about 6 months [77, 99], with the rate of change
decreasing in the longer term. Body shape changes de-
pend on the exercise programme performed, which in
turn is typically created based on exercise goals. There-
fore we elicited each participant’s exercise goals through
a questionnaire and when talking to them during the
design of their idealistic avatar. Then a researcher de-
signed the enhanced avatars by changing the realistic
avatar according these exercise goals and the ideal body
shape as shown in the idealistic avatar, based on a doc-
umented procedure1
[67]. The enhanced avatars retained
the key facial features of the realistic avatar, as opposed
to the idealistic facial features, in order to maintain re-
alism and a high level of similarity identification. The
body shape and muscles of the avatars were adapted
based on estimates of weight loss [135, 103, 118] and
muscle gain [117, 110, 112, 79], mapping a realistic jour-
ney towards their desired body shape with the aim of
increasing wishful identification. In order to keep the
adaptations realistic and consistent across participants,
they were guided by a simple decision tree. The tree
considers the current general body shape of a partici-
pant based on their BMI [41] (‘underweight’, ‘healthy’
and ‘overweight’) and their exercise goals in broad cate-
gories (weight loss, weight maintenance / increased mus-
cle definition, and increased muscle mass). In month 1
(avatar E1), an ‘underweight’ or ‘healthy weight’ partic-
ipant would mainly develop increased muscle tone, and
an ‘overweight’ participant would mainly lose body fat.
By month 6 (avatar E6), visible changes would diverge
more depending on the exercise goals, with muscles be-
coming more defined or increasing in mass. For example,
the bottom half of Figure 6) shows the progression of a
high-BMI male avatar with weight loss and muscle gain
goals. The top half shows a low-BMI female avatar with
a goal of increased muscle definition. The example il-
lustrates that some progressions, e.g. weight loss from
‘overweight’, are more salient than others, e.g. for those
who are well-exercised [99]. We made sure that all par-
ticipants were aware of the changes in their enhanced
avatars by asking and explaining them if necessary.

Hypotheses
Based on our previous studies and theory [73, 131, 30,
51], we posed the following a-priori hypotheses:
H7 Enhancing avatars (from R to E1 and E6) increases
Wishful Identification.
H8 Enhancing avatars (from R to E1 and E6) changes
performance.
Participants
We recruited 17 participants (11 male, 5 female, age 20-
22) similar to Study 2. Three of them also participated
in Study 2. The IPAQ classified 13 as HEPA Active,
three as Minimally Active, and one as Inactive.
Qualitative Results
Fourteen participants expressed that they liked their en-
hanced avatars and that they would like to achieve the
exercise results they represented. Ten participants, es-
pecially those who desired an increase in muscle mass,
noted the six-month enhanced avatars’ (E6) changes
within the exergame. Six participants, especially female
ones with comparatively more subtle goals such as weight
loss and muscle toning, noted that the changes in the 1-
month enhanced avatar (E1) were hard to notice (“This
avatar is very similar to my realistic avatar”), and some
similar but less frequent comments were made for the
6-month enhanced avatar. In particular, male partici-
pants expressed a sense of delight when beating any of
the avatars and noted it was motivating beating the en-
hanced versions of themselves.
Quantitative Results
Results are shown in the bottom section of Table 1 and
in Figure 7. According to a power analysis, the one-way
repeated measures ANOVAs used to test the effects of
avatar type were able to detect small-to-medium effects
(Cohen’s f=0.19) between conditions at α = 0.05 with
8
a power of 0.8. The effect of avatar type (R, E1, E6)
on Wishful Identification (Fig. 7 top left) was significant
(F(2, 32) = 10.38, p < .001), with a ‘large’ effect size
(ω2
= 0.161), therefore we accept H7. Post-hoc tests
with Holm correction showed that Wishful identification
for E6 was significantly higher compared to R (t(16) =
3.730, p = .005) and E1 (t(16) = 3.499, p = .006). How-
ever, the difference between R and E1 is not significant
(t(16) = 1.242, p = .232). The effects of avatar type
on all other identification subscales were not significant
(F(2, 32) ≤ 1.229, p ≥ .306). The effect of avatar type
on Perceived Competence (Fig. 7 bottom right) was sig-
nificant (F(2, 32) = 4.321, p = .022), with a ‘small’ effect
size (ω2
= 0.012). Post-hoc paired t-tests with Holm cor-
rection showed that Perceived Competence for E1 was
significantly higher compared to R (t(16) = 2.976, p =
.027), with (Cohen’s d = 0.722). However, the difference
between R and E6 (t(16) = 0.399, p = .695), and E1 and
E6 (t(16) = 2.242, p = .079) were not significant. The
effect of avatar type on all other IMI subscales, including
Interest/Enjoyment (Fig. 7 bottom left), was not signif-
icant (F(2, 32) ≤ 1.692, p ≥ .200). One-way repeated
measures ANOVAs showed that the effect of avatar type
on FSQ Absorption (F(2, 32) = 0.836, p ≥ .443) and
Balance (F(2, 32) = 0.692, p = .508) were not significant.
A one-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that the
effect of avatar type (R, E1, E6) on ∆Power (Fig. 7 top
right) was not significant (F(2, 32) = 2.788, p < .077),
with a ‘small’ effect size (ω2
≥ 0.012), so we reject H8.
DISCUSSION
There is some evidence that avatars in non-VR, low-to-
medium-intensity exergames have benefits for the player
experience [56, 100] and can improve exercise inten-
tion [71, 66], in particular with idealised avatars able to
lower social physique anxiety [115], increase perceived
interactivity [58] and motivate exercise [71, 66, 96, 95].
However, it is not known how customised avatars af-
fect the player experience in immersive VR exergames,
and in particular, how they affect a player’s physi-
cal performance in exergames designed to challenge the
player with a high physical intensity. Previous studies
have mainly shown an increase in avatar identification
through customisation in games where the user assumes
a definite role or controls a distinct character [129, 14, 17,
73, 33]. These studies typically focused on MMORPGs
and other non-exertion game genres where avatars are
used over an extensive period of time. Our results pro-
vide more evidence that avatar customisation can in-
crease identification (H1, H2) even for a brief exposure to
the customised avatar [71, 66], and that this is relevant in
high-intensity VR exergames. Physical feature selection
can generate custom avatars capable of improving simi-
larity identification, wishful identification, importance to
identity and emotional investment compared to a generic
avatar (H2). Furthermore, we showed that this identi-
fication can be intrinsically motivating in high-intensity
exergames (H3), and not just in non-VR, non-exertion
[17, 127, 116, 18, 33] and low-to-medium exertion games
[71, 66, 96, 95, 72], and that it can also lead to perfor-
mance gains in terms of physical power output (H4).
A possible explanation for these positive effects is feed-
forward [10, 120, 30, 31], a psychological training tech-
nique that achieves performance and motivation gains
through identification with an improved self-model. For
example, feedforward users watch a video of themselves
edited to show only their best performance [32]. Simi-
larly, self-competing with an avatar in VR, similar to our
exergame [10], or creating the illusion of a better perfor-
mance in VR [56] can elicit feedforward effects. Feed-
forward is theorised to rely on mirror neurons, which
are activated when a user identifies with an improved
self-model [30]. Using a customised avatar, compared to
a generic avatar, is likely to increase identification and
hence the feedforward effect. In line with this, social cog-
nitive theory predicts that similarity identification with
a model leads to more learning and imitation of mod-
elled behaviours [39]. Alternatively, self-determination
theory [106] can explain the positive results by arguing
that realistic avatars better fulfill the three main psy-
chological needs that facilitate self-motivation: related-
ness, through increased identification; competence be-
cause players see themselves performing well in the form
of their avatar; and autonomy because a realistic avatar
frames their efforts as self-competition independent of
others [10]. This is congruent with findings for non-
exertion games that preference for an avatar can lead
to greater invested effort [17].
The aforementioned theories also help to explain the
negative impact of idealised avatars on physical perfor-
mance (H6). The concept of wishful identification in-
volves a desire to be more like the avatar [131] and is
strongly related to self-discrepancy [51]. Although the
player may wish to be similar to the avatar in certain
regards, they are actually not, which is also reflected in
a small but consistent reduction of similarity identifica-
tion observed for the idealised avatar in Study 2 and the
enhanced avatars in Study 3. Reduced similarity iden-
tification, in turn, reduces the feedforward effect due to
reduced self-recognition and mirror neuron activity [120,
30, 31]. Similarly, less similarity identification leads to
less learning and imitation of modelled behaviours ac-
cording to social cognitive theory [39], and it also leads
less self-motivation due to reduced relatedness, less ap-
parent self-competence and less apparent autonomy ac-
cording to self-determination theory [106]. The wishful
identification with the idealised avatar can also be in-
terpreted as self-discrepancy on a deeper psychological
level, in the form of a conflict between the Jungian ‘Self’
and the ego [63]. Our inner ‘Self’ is perceived by us
through the distorted lens of our ego, which identifies
with superficial personas such as the desired looks of our
idealised avatar. In line with this, self-determination the-
ory defines two different types of motivation: intrinsic
motivation, which relates to the Self and the deeper en-
joyment of an activity, and extrinsic motivation, which
relates to external control or introjected self-regulation
9
[105]. Intrinsically motivated goals have been found to
positively influence self-determined motivation, physical
self-worth, wellbeing and exercise behaviour, whereas ex-
trinsically motivated goals relating to the body – similar
to our idealised avatars – had a negative effect [44, 111].
In order to describe the influence of identification on mo-
tivation and performance, we propose the notions of in-
trinsic identification, which is based on a recognition of
one’s true Self and fostering a sense of oneness with the
Self, and extrinsic identification, which is based on per-
sonas projected by the ego and drawing the attention
away from the Self. In accordance with this, the dis-
tinction between “Koerper” – the material body – and
“Leib” – the animate body inhabited by the Self – has
been proposed to guide the holistic design of exergames
[82]: while an idealised avatar focuses on the material
body we do not have and the corresponding persona pro-
jected by our ego, the realistic avatar respects our body
and ourselves for what we are.
We could not find related work demonstrating clear neg-
ative effects of idealised custom avatars, such as the neg-
ative impact on physical performance (H6) observed in
Study 2. In related works both realistic [127, 134, 17,
116] and idealised [121, 65, 60, 56] custom avatars were
found beneficial for identification, game enjoyment and
flow, and avatars were found to become more important
to participants when they project more aspects of their
ideal self [33, 27, 9]. Notably, Jin discussed the poten-
tial for self-discrepancy of idealised vs. realistic avatars
in exergames [58], but her empirical results were mixed
and mainly favoured idealised avatars. A possible expla-
nation for this is that unlike typical non-exertion or low-
to-medium exertion games, our high-intensity exergame
was affected by ego depletion, the phenomenon that in-
tense physical and emotional exertion reduces willpower
and motivation [12, 61]. Thus, the motivational and
performance benefits gained from feedforward and self-
determined, intrinsic motivation may have had a greater
effect on maintaining performance in these situations
[109, 47]. Furthermore, Study 3 about enhanced avatars
indicates that a small degree of idealisation may not have
a negative effect. The enhanced avatars (E1 and E6), es-
pecially the 6-months enhanced avatar (E6), managed to
increase wishful identification (H7) at a relatively small
cost of similarity identification and no other notable dis-
advantages. Qualitative comments of studies 2 and 3
indicate that despite their potential disadvantages, ide-
alisation of avatars can be an entertaining game element.
Limitations
We used only one avatar creation tool and one VR ex-
ergame, so it is unclear how well the results can be gener-
alised without further work. However, the exergame and
the avatar creation tool contained many elements typi-
cal for such systems. Similarly, our participants were
mainly young university students. It would be interest-
ing to consider the effect of different demographics, such
as older participants with higher BMIs, as well as longer-
term effects of avatars in future work. The sample sizes
were relatively small; however, the power analyses con-
firmed that they were large enough to detect the hypoth-
esised effects and, except for Study 3, they did detect
them. Study 3 was sufficiently powered to detect small-
to-medium effects, and the observed effects were very
small (ω2
< 0.01, with ω2
= 0.1 commonly regarded as
‘small’ [91]), making it unlikely more participants, with-
out other changes, would lead to meaningful differences.
The changes in the enhanced avatars may not have been
very salient during the exergame, and the complex in-
teraction between intrinsic and extrinsic identification
should be further investigated in future work; however,
the changes were salient enough to lead to a significant
increase in wishful identification.
Impact on Exergame Design
Improving intrinsic motivation with customised avatars
(H2) is important for exergames aimed at helping people
to be physically active as intrinsic motivation is an im-
portant predictor of adherence to an exercise program [3,
107, 40]. Health guidelines recommend regular exercise
of moderate or vigorous intensity [89], but intense ex-
ercise generally decreases intrinsic motivation [105, 34].
While it is known that good exergame design enhances
intrinsic motivation [37, 101, 35, 113], our results demon-
strate that, even with increased exercise intensity, intrin-
sic motivation can be improved specifically through cus-
tomised avatars. By motivating players with avatar cus-
tomisation (H2), exergame designers may be able to mit-
igate the large dropout rates observed for people starting
an exercise programme [5, 6, 29, 36]. Furthermore, it is
a challenge to motivate people to exercise at sufficient
intensity [38, 92] and maintain high-intensity exercise
[88, 20], also in exergames [98, 15, 10]. To address this,
exergame designers could offer avatar customisation as
a tool to elicit an increased player performance (H4).
Avatars that are more realistic than idealistic are likely
to be beneficial (H6). Designers could avoid the pitfalls
of extrinsic identification and self-discrepancy by offering
suitable customisation functions that do not encourage
or facilitate overly idealised avatars, to foster intrinsic
identification and positively affect the way players relate
to their own body [83], e.g. by focusing on avatar real-
ism or automating the avatar customisation process [52,
53, 2]. Interestingly, this is in contrast to some previ-
ous recommendations that “exergame developers should
consider designing avatars that are slim and toned” [72].
CONCLUSIONS
We conducted three studies investigating the effects of
avatar customisation in a VR exergame, concluding that:
1. Exergame designers should consider using realistic
avatar customisation to improve player experience and
performance in exergames.
2. Idealised avatars can increase wishful identification
but may impact physical performance negatively.
3. ‘Enhancing’ a realistic avatar with some idealised
characteristics may provide a suitable interface to sup-
port progression with an exercise regime.
