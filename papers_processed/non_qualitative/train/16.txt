Abstract
Pre-trained language models (PLMs) achieve
great success in NLP. However, their huge
model sizes hinder their applications in many
practical systems. Knowledge distillation is a
popular technique to compress PLMs, which
learns a small student model from a large
teacher PLM. However, the knowledge learned
from a single teacher may be limited and even
biased, resulting in low-quality student model.
In this paper, we propose a multi-teacher
knowledge distillation framework named MT-
BERT for pre-trained language model com-
pression, which can train high-quality student
model from multiple teacher PLMs. In MT-
BERT we design a multi-teacher co-finetuning
method to jointly finetune multiple teacher
PLMs in downstream tasks with shared pool-
ing and prediction layers to align their output
space for better collaborative teaching. In ad-
dition, we propose a multi-teacher hidden loss
and a multi-teacher distillation loss to transfer
the useful knowledge in both hidden states and
soft labels from multiple teacher PLMs to the
student model. Experiments on three bench-
mark datasets validate the effectiveness of MT-
BERT in compressing PLMs.
1 Introduction
Pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT
and RoBERTa have achieved notable success in
various NLP tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al.,
2019; Liu et al., 2019). However, many PLMs have
a huge model size and computational complexity,
making it difficult to deploy them to low-latency
and high-concurrence online systems or devices
with limited computational resources (Jiao et al.,
2020; Wu et al., 2021).
Knowledge distillation is a widely used tech-
nique for compressing large-scale pre-trained lan-
guage models (Sun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020).
For example, Sanh et al. (2019) proposed Distil-
BERT to compress BERT by transferring knowl-
edge from the soft labels predicted by the teacher
model to student model with a distillation loss. Jiao
et al. (2020) proposed TinyBERT, which aligns the
hidden states and the attention heatmaps between
student and teacher models. These methods usu-
ally learn the student model from a single teacher
model (Gou et al., 2020). However, the knowledge
and supervision provided by a single teacher model
may be insufficient to learn an accurate student
model, and the student model may also inherit the
bias in the teacher model (Bhardwaj et al., 2020).
Fortunately, many different large PLMs such as
BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al.,
2019) and UniLM (Dong et al., 2019) are off-the-
shelf. These PLMs may encode complementary
knowledge because they usually have different con-
figurations and are trained on different corpus with
different self-supervision tasks (Qiu et al., 2020).
Thus, incorporating multiple pre-trained language
models into knowledge distillation has the potential
to learn better student models.
In this paper, we present a multi-teacher knowl-
edge distillation method named MT-BERT for pre-
trained language model compression.1 In MT-
BERT, we propose a multi-teacher co-finetuning
framework to jointly finetune multiple teacher mod-
els with a shared pooling and prediction module to
align their output hidden states for better collabo-
rative student teaching. In addition, we propose a
multi-teacher hidden loss and a multi-teacher dis-
tillation loss to transfer the useful knowledge in
both hidden states and soft labels from multiple
teacher models to student model. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets show MT-BERT can ef-
fectively improve the quality of student models for
PLM compression and outperform many single-
teacher knowledge distillation methods.

2 MT-BERT
Next, we introduce the details of our multi-teacher
knowledge distillation method MT-BERT for pre-
trained language model compression.2 We first in-
troduce the multi-teacher co-finetuning framework
to jointly finetune multiple teacher models in down-
stream tasks, and then introduce the multi-teacher
distillation framework to collaboratively teach the
student with multiple teachers.
2.1 Multi-Teacher Co-Finetuning
Researchers have found that distilling the knowl-
edge in the hidden states of a teacher model is
important for effective student teaching (Sun et al.,
2019; Jiao et al., 2020). However, since different
teacher PLMs are separately pre-trained with dif-
ferent settings, finetuning them independently may
lead to some inconsistency in their feature space,
which is not optimal for transferring knowledge in
the hidden states of multiple teachers. Thus, we
design a multi-teacher co-finetuning framework to
obtain some uniformity among the hidden states
output by the last layer of different teacher models
for better collaborative student teaching, as shown
in Fig. 1. Assume there are N teacher models, and
denote the hidden states output by the top layer of
the i-th teacher as Hi. We use a shared pooling3
layer to summarize each hidden matrix Hi into
a unified text embedding, and then use a shared
dense layer to convert it into a soft probability vec-
tor yi. Finally, we jointly optimize the summation
of the task-specific losses of all teacher models,
i.e.,
PN
i=1 CE(y, yi), where CE(·, ·) stands for the
cross-entropy loss and y is the ground-truth label.
Since the pooling and prediction layers are shared
among different teachers, the feature space of the
output hidden states from different teacher PLMs
can be aligned, which can help them collaborate
better for student teaching.
2.2 Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation
Next, we introduce our proposed multi-teacher
knowledge distillation framework, which is shown
in Fig. 2. Two loss functions are used for knowl-
edge distillation, i.e., a multi-teacher hidden loss
and a multi-teacher distillation loss.
The multi-teacher hidden loss aims to transfer
knowledge in the hidden states of multiple teachers.

better than average pooling and “[CLS]” token embedding.

Input Text
Figure 1: The multi-teacher co-finetuning framework.
Assume there are N teacher PLMs, and each of
them has T × K Transformer layers. They collab-
oratively teach a student model with K layers, and
each layer in the student model corresponds to T
layers in teacher PLMs.4 Denote the hidden states
output by the j-th layer of the student model as Hs
j,
and the corresponding hidden states output by the
(T × j)-th layer of the i-th teacher model as Hi
Tj.
Following (Sun et al., 2019), we apply the mean
squared error (MSE) to the hidden states of corre-
sponding layers in the student and teacher models
to encourage the student model to have similar
functions with teacher models. The multi-teacher
hidden loss LMT−Hid is formulated as follows:
LMT−Hid =
N
X
i=1
T
X
j=1
MSE(Hs
j , WijHi
Tj), (1)
where Wij is a learnable transformation matrix.
The multi-teacher distillation loss aims to trans-
fer the knowledge in the soft labels output by multi-
ple teachers to student. The predictions of different
teachers on the same sample may have different
correctness and confidence. Thus, it may be sub-
optimal to simply ensemble (Fukuda et al., 2017;
Liu et al., 2020) or choose (Yuan et al., 2020) soft
labels without the help of task labels. Since in task-
specific knowledge distillation the labels of train-
ing samples are available, we propose a distillation
loss weighting method to assign different weights
to different samples. The weights are based on the
loss inferred from the predictions of corresponding
teacher against the gold labels. More specifically,
the multi-teacher distillation loss LMT−Dis is for-
mulated as follows:
LMT−Dis =
N
X
i=1
CE(yi/t, ys/t)
1 + CE(y, yi)
, (2)
4
Here we assume that all teacher models have the same
number of layers. We will explore to generalize MT-BERT to
scenarios where teacher models have different architectures in
our future work.

where t is the temperature coefficient. In this way,
if a teacher’s prediction on a certain sample is more
close to the ground-truth label, its corresponding
distillation loss will gain higher weight.
Following (Tang et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2020),
we also incorporate gold labels to compute the task-
specific loss LTask based on the predictions of the
student model, i.e., LTask = CE(y, ys). The final
loss function L for learning the student model is a
summation of the multi-teacher hidden loss, multi-
teacher distillation loss and the task-specific loss,
which is formulated as follows:
L = LMT−Hid + LMT−Dis + LTask. (3)
3 Experiments
3.1 Datasets and Experimental Settings
We conduct experiments on three benchmark
datasets with different sizes. The first one is SST-
2 (Socher et al., 2013), which is a benchmark for
text sentiment classification. The second one is
RTE (Bentivogli et al., 2009), which is a widely
used dataset for natural language inference. The
third one is the MIND dataset (Wu et al., 2020c),
which is a large-scale public English news dataset.5
We perform the news topic classification task on
this dataset. The detailed statistics of the three
datasets are shown in Table 1.
In our experiments, we use the pre-trained 12-
layer BERT, RoBERTa and UniLM (Bao et al.,
2020)6 models as the teachers to distill a 6-layer

and a 4-layer student models respectively. We use
the token embeddings and the first 4 or 6 Trans-
former layers of UniLM to initialize the parameters
of the student model. The pooling layer is imple-
mented by an attention network (Yang et al., 2016;
Wu et al., 2020a). The temperature coefficient t is
set to 1. The attention query dimension in the at-
tentive pooling layer is 200. The optimizer we use
is Adam (Bengio and LeCun, 2015). The teacher
model learning rate is 2e-6 while the student model
learning rate is 5e-6. The batch size is 64. Follow-
ing (Jiao et al., 2020), we report the accuracy score
on the SST-2 and RTE datasets. In addition, since
the news topics in the MIND dataset are highly
imbalanced, following (Wu et al., 2020b) we report
both accuracy and macro-F1 scores. Each exper-
iment is independently repeated 5 times and the
average scores are reported.
3.2 Performance Evaluation
We compare the performance of MT-BERT with
two groups of baselines. The first group includes
the 12-layer version of the teacher models, i.e.,
BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al.,
2019) and UniLM (Bao et al., 2020). The sec-
ond group includes the 6-layer and 4-layer student

methods are summarized in Table 2.7 Referring
to this table, we find MT-BERT can consistently
outperform all the single-teacher knowledge distil-
lation methods compared here. This is because the
knowledge provided by a single teacher model may
be insufficient, and incorporating the complemen-
tary knowledge encoded in multiple teacher models
can help learn better student model. In addition,

compared with the teacher models, MT-BERT has
much fewer parameters and its performance is com-
parable or even better than these teacher models.
It shows that MT-BERT can effectively inherit the
knowledge of multiple teacher models even if the
model size is significantly compressed.
We also compare MT-BERT with several multi-
teacher knowledge distillation methods proposed in
the computer vision field that ensemble the outputs
of different teachers for student teaching (You et al.,
2017; Liu et al., 2020). The results are shown in
Fig. 3. We find our MT-BERT performs better than
these ensemble-based multi-teacher knowledge dis-
tillation methods. This is because these methods do
not consider the correctness of the teacher model
predictions on a specific sample and cannot trans-
fer useful knowledge encoded in the intermediate
layers, which may not be optimal for collaborative
knowledge distillation from multiple teachers.
3.3 Effectiveness of Multiple Teachers
Next, we study the effectiveness of using multiple
teacher PLMs for knowledge distillation. We com-
pare the performance of the 6-layer student model
distilled from different combinations of teacher
models. The results are summarized in Table 3.
It shows that using multiple teacher PLMs can
achieve better performance than using a single one.
This is because different teacher models can en-
code complementary knowledge and combining
them together can provide better supervision for
student model. In addition, combining all three
teacher PLMs can further improve the performance
of student model, which validates the effectiveness
of MT-BERT in distilling knowledge from multiple
teacher models.
3.4 Ablation Study
We study the effectiveness of the two important
techniques in MT-BERT, i.e., the multi-teacher
co-finetuning framework and the distillation loss

weighting method. We compare MT-BERT and
its variants with one of these modules removed, as
shown in Fig. 4. The student model has 6 layers.
We find the multi-teacher co-finetuning framework
is very important. This is because the hidden states
of different teacher models can be in very differ-
ent spaces, and jointly finetuning multiple teachers
with shared pooling and prediction layers can align
their output hidden spaces for better collaborative
student teaching. In addition, the distillation loss
weighting method is also useful. This is because
the predictions of different teachers on the same
sample may have different correctness, and focus-
ing on the more reliable predictions is helpful for
distilling accurate student models.
We also verify the effectiveness of different loss
functions in MT-BERT, which is shown in Fig. 5.
We find the task loss is very important. It is because
in our experiments the corpus for task-specific dis-
tillation are not large and the direct supervision
from task labels is useful. In addition, the dis-
tillation loss is also important. It indicates that
transferring the knowledge in soft labels plays a
critical role in knowledge distillation. Moreover,
the hidden loss is also helpful. It shows that hid-
den states of different teacher models can provide
useful knowledge for student model learning.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a multi-teacher knowl-
edge distillation method named MT-BERT for pre-
trained language model compression, which can
learn small but strong student model from multiple
teacher PLMs in a collaborative way. We propose
a multi-teacher co-finetuning framework to align
the output hidden states of multiple teacher models
for better collaborative student teaching. In addi-
tion, we design a multi-teacher hidden loss and a
multi-teacher distillation loss to transfer the useful
knowledge in both hidden states and prediction of
multiple teacher models to student model. The ex-
tensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that MT-BERT can effectively improve the
performance of pre-trained language model com-
pression, and can outperform many single-teacher
knowledge distillation methods.
